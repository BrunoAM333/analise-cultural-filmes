IMDb,False,"While I enjoy this movie for what it is, I simply have to disagree with all of those who portray this movie as some beautiful love story. This movie is about love, but it is not a love story. Without giving away any spoilers, if you want to understand the movie pay attention to the very last act of the main character when the movie ends. The movie is about relationships and how difficult human relationships especially can be. However in the end because we are human those are the only relationships we can truly have - are with each other - and the hurt and vulnerability and sometimes pain that come with them is simply something we have to accept. And no matter how much you love or care for a person sometimes it just doesn't work out. However that does not mean that you did not love or care for that person and to a certain extent will always. This is what the main character realizes and comes to understand at the end of the movie.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Fairly rare one of a kind film. A high concept film that actually stays true to its core idea yet without losing viewer interest. Some irony here. While the film never becomes completely predictable, even to a jaded reviewer like this one, its process of de-constructing human relationship (brilliant, and better than all Woody Allen's films combined) generates the sequential ""connections"" with the viewer (ie, experiences that every viewer can relate to) which in turn keep the empathy going long after the initial sci fi ""wow"" is gone. Watching this (as an aside) you have to wonder if Scarlett Johansson's career can get any more interesting? In the Marvel films she plays an uber-woman, In LUCY she a woman who evolves beyond evolution itself. And here yet again she plays an OS that transcends reality. Makes for a nice resume. Notice how Amy Adams plays every scene with no makeup? Talk about a director making every effort to keep an actor's natural beauty from hijacking the film...?",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Science fiction has been dominated by 'space westerns' for so long that the occasional concept- based story situation hits a big number on my personal richter scale. What does it mean to be human? And if we create near-humans what is our responsibility to them and what is their relationship to us? These themes underpinned Blade Runner and Spielberg's A.I. And Sci Fi of the 50s and 60s dealt with machine self awareness. None of the films that touched on this subject in the past presented it so thoroughly, intimately and believably. Her is in the near future, but everything we see is within reach now: the isolation and starkness of the ""business district,"" the oppressive scale of the architecture (with thin, clumsy attempts to soften its sterility) and the need for continuous connection to remote voices. A personal assistant that learns independently and takes initiative for its hapless user, ""Her"" is at once the ideal tool and — who knows — perhaps closer to the next level of evolution. Pitch perfect performances and direction kept me in the story. As others have said, the locations, cinematography and even music shine in the fabric of this film. Spike Jonze is a master story weaver at the top of his game. Joaquin Phoenix is utterly credible as are all the other leads. Even Scarlett Johansson, who has not always seemed a strong actress to me performs utterly convincingly. It's an adult-themed film in more ways than one, but especially in the best way: it makes you think about a reality that's right around the corner.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Another movie that i say ""i should've watched before"". Intense romantic drama. Fascinating portrait of loneliness in a post-digital world. Amazingly original screenplay, concept, musics, especially colors and performance from Joaquin Phoenix. This made me stay with myself after the credits have finished, i found myself reflecting on my own life and relationships.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"A great film about loneliness. Splendid performance of Joaquin Phoenix. And pure poetry. Admirable poem about isolation, need of other, social surogate and , off course, freedom.

IMDb,False,"This is the best film I have seen all year, and I saw just about every good film to hit theaters in 2013. I think it's because it is so representational of what it's like to be human. There are so many things that make this movie special, but I'll just mention a few. 1. The score is INCREDIBLE. The music paired with the beautiful sound design make you FEEL the movie. Sure, you see everything on the screen, which is already beautiful, but then that music hits you and the emotions just start to run. I laughed, I cried, my brain got all tingly. It was an emotional roller coaster, and the score assisted in that so well. 2. The script. I knew how this movie was going to end 30 minutes in. And unlike most who would then say that it's predictable and not worth watching, I consider that awesome, because it means that the script is tight enough to tell a good story with a believable arc. Every scene in this movie is straight up powerful! Like it will fill your heart with sadness and happiness and pain and guilt and confusion. And then rinse and repeat. For 2 hours. It moves through all of the most complex and interesting questions that we should be asking ourselves about what it means to be a human being. About what it means to be alive. This film is about all that life is. And after the screening, as well as during, I found myself questioning things in my own life that either don't make sense or don't have to make sense. Like love and thoughts and emotions. They're all so natural and yet none of us truly understand how they work. In my opinion, moreso than any other film this year, Her has the perfect mix of complex ideas, story, and character development. One of the best scripts ever written. 3. Cinematography. My personal favorite shot to see and use is the extreme close up. And that shot was all over this movie. The reason I love it so much and believe it works so well is because it allows you to see the emotions of the character so plainly. Like their face is right in your face, so you just have to look at it. And that's where Joaquin shines. He delivers such a powerful and emotional performance and the close ups are there to capture it all. They also make great use of the natural backlighting of Shanghai, and the colors all fuse to make it a really pretty movie. I'd say the cinematography is on par with Drive and/or Lost in Translation in terms of the style. It looks like every shot was photographed with the intent to make it the most beautiful shot in the film. And I admire the DP's work. He did a really great job. More than anything though, this film just made me feel. Everything about it was so beautiful. I didn't want it to end. I felt like the film was controlling me - playing with my mind as if it were a joystick. And that's just something you don't get every day. Very rarely am I awe- stricken by a movie, and this film made my jaw drop. It is without a doubt the best film of the year, and upon just one viewing, one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Okay let's get something straight: There is nothing I love more than badass, exhilarating movies! The Joker performing his little pencil magic trick, Indiana Jones dodging traps and swinging his lion-taming whip at enemies, the bride in kill bill punching her way out of a closed coffin with her bare hands, John McClane single-handedly annihilating an airplane in mid-air while exclaiming the best one-liner known to mankind and I could go on and on... HOWEVER, nothing compares to the emotional rollercoaster the movie ""Her"" took me. It's nothing short of a masterpiece, a unique way of describing a love story and it makes you think of what it actually means to be human.
I just didn't want it to end and even after multiple rewatches, it still manages to take me off guard and make me tear up because of how beautiful and sad at the same time it all is. I can't remember any movie being able to achieve that. So yeah, definitely check this one out. And for those who are wondering: this is my third favourite movie of all time.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"This film was not at all what I was expecting but in a great way! I'm not a fan of Rom Coms or romances generally, and this film isn't that, although it has romantic elements to a degree. This film is more sci-fi than anything with a really interesting and fascinating twist, but also creepy and unsettling concept of relationships with an artificial intelligence. This film was perfectly cast and I can't think of better individuals to play each role. Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson do an incredible job!!!!!!! The film was paced perfectly and didn't drag at all. The film explores the themes of human interaction, emotional ranges of humans, the concept of love, companionship, loneliness, physical touch and so much more. I really enjoyed this film both for it's originality and the ability to make you sit in discomfort but want to explore further. This film makes you reflect on the relationships in your own life, life generally and the world as a whole. This film is beautiful in its cinematography, the musical score and I'm surprised it isn't more renowned. Honestly, a masterpiece in my opinion. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"""Her"" is a film set in the very, very near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) is a very lonely and emotionally constricted man. He's getting a divorce and seems very isolated--even though he lives in a huge city. One day, he decides to upgrade to a new hyper-intelligent operating system--one that claims to have a real personality. Well, it turns out to be so and then some. In fact, the computer OS, Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), is like a person in so many ways that soon it becomes all- important to Theodore and eventually it's his girlfriend. Where all this goes is a very slow journey, but it's also quite beautiful. This film, while sci-fi, doesn't seem outside the realm of possibility. In this often disconnected and cold world, such a relationship seems like a safe alternative. Healthy, of course not--but very safe for a scarred person who wants intimacy but who is afraid to seek it. I thought the film had a really interesting message about this and is well worth seeing. My only reservation is that the film is VERY adult--with phone sex and a bit of nudity you probably wouldn't want your kids to see. Plus, at times the film feels a bit creepy. Good...but a bit sad and creepy. Well worth your time and an interesting performance by Phoenix and a really amazing film by Spike Jonze.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Spike Jonze's latest feature 'Her', set in the not-too-distant future, tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Phoenix) who finds himself falling in love with 'Samantha', an advanced operating system voiced by the sultry Scarlett Johansson. It is clear to see why this film was chosen by the National Board of Review as the best film of 2013: the visual style and extensive use of pastel colours is a triumph in itself, and the acting, editing, costumes and screenplay are all worthy of recognition. I went to an awards screening of 'Her' and was pleased to find out that the film was not at all what I was expecting. It has such a distinct style, and Joaquin Phoenix carries the film with tremendous grace as the complicated and sensitive protagonist. The film is mostly Phoenix alone with Johansson's voice (reminiscent of Sandra Bullock in 'Gravity' or Robert Redford in 'All Is Lost' - two other 2013 films mainly revolving around one solitary character), but the audience never feels abandoned by the lack of other characters as we begin to forget that 'Samantha' is just really just a computer. 'Her' is a complex film with a much deeper meaning that lies beneath the surface. A beautifully crafted motion picture, this quirky love story is sure to resonate with you once you've seen it. It is an extremely interesting (and realistic) look at the future - Jonze's quaint and poignant film is a must-see! 9/10",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Well, I wasn't prepared for that. Her is such a haunting and intimate look into loneliness and sorrow, and happiness and love. It's a film that anyone who has ever felt lonely or heartbroken will immediately relate to. But it's also an incredibly personal experience. The more I have thought about this wonderful film that I just saw, the more I realize how impactful it was to me. It was heartwarming yet heartbreaking. It was sad yet funny. Like life, it was a rollercoaster of emotions. One minute you are laughing and the next you are crying. There is no right or wrong, there are just our feelings and emotions and the way we process them. For me, the most impactful part of this film was the sense of loneliness. Anyone who has experienced it knows that it isn't easy. And even though I'm completely fine with being by myself most of the time, there is always that longing to find that someone. This movie captured that feeling so incredibly perfectly. That's where the beauty of this film lies. We can all reflect our experiences and feelings into this movie and it will reflect something back. It turns into such a personal experience and journey, that it becomes impossible to put it into words. I don't think that I have ever experienced anything quite like Her, at least when it comes to cinema. I can already tell now that I won't be able to stop thinking about this film for the next couple of days. I think that everyone should see this film at least once in their life. It's a journey of discovery and reflection. Trying to explain what this film is, is simply impossible. It's something that one needs to experience for themself. Also, can we just talk about that final shot? I don't think that it gets much more perfect than that.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"Talk about closing with a bang. Spike Jonze's long-awaited original film about a writer that falls in love with his operating system is not only the best film to play at this year's New York Film Festival; it very well could be the very best film of the year. ""Her"" is the finest writing and directorial endeavor of Spike Jonze's career. And then there's the towering and crowning work of Academy Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix who proves once again, he's the finest actor working today, hands down. You can't find a more dynamic and compelling story about the human connection and where we're headed as a society. When ""Her"" opens up, it snaps you immediately into the story. Phoenix plays Theodore, a writer for a website that makes letters for just about anyone. As he tries to find life during the midst of his divorce from his wife Catherine (played by a beautiful Rooney Mara), Theodore finds solace in a friendship with a new OS (operating system) named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). The two develop a relationship in a world where OS's are becoming the norm with society. Jonze's has never been the conventional director as we've seen in his other brilliant efforts ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Jonze sets out to tell a story and deliver all the intricate details for us to understand each character. His focus on Theodore, giving him a real sense of loneliness without falling into cliché character ticks and beats that we've seen countless times in other romantic films, Jonze constructs a real man living in a world where technology has taken precedent over human connection. Christopher Nolan should take notes from Jonze on the assembling of female counterparts in a story. Catherine and Theodore's friend Amy, played by the always dependable Amy Adams, both feel genuinely authentic. Mara, who's already delivered one other powerful performance in ""Ain't Them Bodies Saints"" earlier this year, is finely utilized. She shows once again that she's a true professional, with limited screen time (many in flashbacks); she can staple herself in your memory. Amy Adams is always the sprinkle on top in all of her films. As ""Amy,"" the awkward friend and neighbor who sympathizes more with Theodore more than she'd like to, Adams expertly executes. With four prior Oscar nominations to her credit, her stunning portrayal is just another fantastic pin to add to her credits. She could find traction during the awards season if the film hits in the right way. That's also part to the petty Oscar rules about rewarding voice performances because if that wasn't the case, Scarlett Johansson would be on stage holding an Oscar of her own next March. As ""Samantha,"" Johansson has never tapped into the essence of her abilities as an actress the way she does in ""Her."" As an OS, full of wonder and curiosity, ""Samantha"" is essentially a child. Learning at a rapid rate and studying the behaviors of the human mind, she looks at the world through the eyes of Theodore. Johansson holds our hand in through the tale, even when her voice isn't on screen. This is the type of work that could convince the Board of Governors to rethink the eligibility of an acting performance. This is a masterful work that I'll remember for years to come. And then there's Joaquin Phoenix...oh, Mr. Phoenix. Fresh off his historic performance in Paul Thomas Anderson's ""The Master"" just a year ago, I didn't think he could impress me so soon and yet here we are. His sensitive and perceptive take on the role is what films are all about. It's one of the best things that 2013 has offered and a performance that could land him his first Oscar. I think Phoenix himself was impressed with the work he and his colleagues have accomplished. At the press conference, he actually gave an answer to one of the questions from the audience. If anyone was in attendance at the conference for James Gray's ""The Immigrant"" - a prickly, disengaged Phoenix put on his sunglasses and put the microphone on the floor. This is a performance that you can identify with. He's not simply awkward for the sake of being, he has baggage and connection issues. There's sincerity in his words and mannerisms. A getaway in a cabin, alone but with ""Samantha"" encapsulates everything about Theodore. Phoenix achieves the impossible and is an instant Oscar contender. But ""Her"" isn't just about the writing and performances; it's an all- around technical marvel. Most notably the Production Design of K.K. Barrett, who has worked on ""Where the Wild Things Are."" Our story takes place in a futuristic (though never said how far ahead) Los Angeles and with shooting overseas, Barrett captures the clout of the city and its inside counterparts. Cinematographer Hoyte Van Hoytema's use of colors and smooth palettes are things of a dream. Affectionately snuggling up to Phoenix as he whispers the sweetness of words to ""Samantha"" or the sweetness of a new letter at work, Hoytema has quickly become one of my favorite DP's, especially following ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""Let the Right One In."" Arcade Fire and Karen O. are simply magic in their music that accompanies our story about love. A modern yet classical composition that in key scenes could move you to tears. ""Her"" is one of the best love stories I've witnessed in some time. Charlie Kaufman will always have the honor of penning my favorite love story of all-time ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" but Spike Jonze and ""Her"" are giving it a true run for the money at the moment.

IMDb,False,"""It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity."" Albert Einstein No better romance is on the screen in 2013 than Spike Jonze's insightful Her. It's about a writer in the future, Theodore, who falls in love with his new operating system (gravelly, sexy voice of Scarlett Johansson), just as he is reluctantly divorcing Catherine (Rooney Mara). The always complicated paths of love make sense as we witness the Platonic relationship develop, sans flesh and sans insanity that usually comes with that flesh. Her is a simple film that offers a view of love I never thought could come from a machine and its software. Although critics will cite the theme as a screed against the distancing of technology and our growing isolation from each other, and they will be right, I offer the sub theme that only when we strip ourselves of sensual bonds can we see the purity of emotional love, an essence of which Plato would have approved. Yes, although technology is mediating our lives at a rapid pace, we fall back to a personal drive to love and be loved that is physical in its best form but understood best if we can distance ourselves from that physicality. This delightfully intimate and non-violent film from acclaimed absurdist director Spike Jonze is more emotionally involving than even Enough Said (one of 2013's best romances) because the interaction between the software and the man is all verbal, no glimpse of the gorgeous Johansson allowed. Although this intuitive OS does allow mind sex, even that activity is abstract, allowing us to realize how connecting with a live human is in the mind still and one of life's great gifts, orgasm or not. Her allows us to witness the evolution of love separate from the encumbrances of physicality. Released from the bonds of appearance, voice is the seducer, not in rude sexual nuance but rather in the care that comes from love of the mind, not the body. K.K. Barrett's production design, Austin Gorg's art direction, and Gene Serdena's set decoration are memorable: full of comfortable light, much glass overlooking the city, and modern but warm furniture both in LA and Singapore. These artists understand that the fusion of technology and art is not a battle but a collaboration that further helps us understand the intricate workings of human emotion. ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" Arthur C. Clarke",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"In a near future, the lonely Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company and he is divorcing of his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new video game. His best friend is his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who is married with Charles (Matt Letscher). One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice (Scarlett Johansson) and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve. ""Her"" is an original movie by the cult writer and director Spike Jonze. The story is emotional and the viewer shares the feelings of love of Theodore and Samantha. The plot is developed in a future not far from the present days and it is easy to understand the need of a writer to write letters since the persons are too individualist, walking on the streets talking to their computers, cellphones or tablets and certainly incapable to write letters with feelings. The conclusion is predictable since fortunately we are still humans. If you liked this movie, see also ""Thomas est Amoureux"" (2000) that you may have a nice surprise. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): ""Ela"" (""She"")",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"I've been a fan of Spike Jonze's films since I first saw Being John Malkovich. Although the wonderful script deserves some of the credit for making that film so great, it was immediately clear to me that Spike Jonze was a director with a fresh and imaginative perspective. His next film, the 2002 meta-comedy Adaptation, confirmed this with its dry wit and multilayered narrative. Now, after a slightly less successful (but still enjoyable) adaptation of Where The Wild Things Are, Spike Jonze has written and directed his most complete and poignant film yet, Her. The story, taking place in a near future when people spend more time talking to their computers than they do to each other, stars Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man whose job is to write heartfelt personal letters for people not willing to do it themselves. Theodore happens to see an ad for a new computer operating system that is programmed with a personality, and decides to give it a shot. His new operating system Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson, is not only intelligent but also charming and understanding, and she and Theo quickly fall in love. It's understandable if that premise sounds bizarre on paper, but in execution Her is far more sweet than creepy. The film radiates warmth and intelligence, and there is a fair amount of witty humor to ensure that it never becomes too self-serious. It has an engaging style similar to that of Sofia Coppola's Lost In Translation. Like in that film, there's a certain poetic yet whimsical quality to the dialogue in Her and both the main characters are plagued by feelings of loneliness. Beyond the romance though, Her has a lot to say about modern society's obsession with technology. The people in this futuristic vision of Los Angeles walk around talking to their computers and ignoring each other entirely, not unlike people today staring at their cell phones rather than talking to those around them. Needless to say it's not a wildly original message, but it's communicated in a unique enough way that it works. I've seen Her twice now, and the more I think about it the more I feel that Spike Jonze has crafted the best film of 2013. Her is equally heartfelt and heartbreaking, a deeply personal and thoroughly enjoyable futuristic love story.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"At the heart of every truly great science-fiction film there is an emphasis on character that aims to reflect on some element of the human condition usually intended to open our minds to thought provoking predictions or eerily warn of an impending reality. We've seen numerous examples of these contemplative films throughout the very existence of cinema stemming all the way back to Fritz Lang's haunting futuristic piece Metropolis and has inspired countless others in its thoughtful wake as seen in memorable cinematic creations such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, Andrei Tarkovsky's Stalker, and even Duncan Jones' Moon. Never to be a director to back away from experimental presentation or psychological study, Spike Jonze's Her fully embraces this reflective science-fiction quality by peering into the deep sociable aspects of the human psyche giving us more of a prophetical reality than a fictional reflection. In his latest film Jonze creates a disconcerting yet equally endearing romance between a secluded depressive and his female operating system with an evolving consciousness, basically a HAL-9000 homage from Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, that brings to light a commentary on our dependency of programmed living and our need to maintain sociability when direct communication avenues have been stricken from life's normality. Rarely do ambitious films meet idyllically with their inquisitive potential, but Jonze has fashioned a delicately profound science-fiction contemplation that is depicted through the thoughtfulness of character alone that brims with wry humor, authentic pain, and charming revelation. Through the use of beautiful cinematography, impeccable production design, and subtle yet evocative performances, Her becomes a multilayered film experience where its character study of an isolated man afraid to become vulnerable again blends harmoniously with a truly unconventional yet naturally heartfelt romance. Jonze's affinity and ambition for presenting psychological challenges, as he has done before with Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and especially in Where the Wild Things Are, finally collides with emotionally piercing conveyance within Her making it as thought provoking and as it is undeniably sweet. If the sole purpose of the science-fiction genre is to expound on societal, moral, and deeply psychological aspects of our human condition than Her fits soundly within that genre's capabilities by capturing our condition's essential need for sociability and love uncomfortably linking it with our antisocial dependency on technology.",Her,2013,Western
IMDb,False,"I saw Her this weekend, and it's my favorite movie of the year. Everything about it was fantastic: the acting, the directing, the writing. It could've easily been a clichéd look at technology or the future, but it's fundamentally a very human story about evolution. It's about having to deal with unfulfillment and things like divorce and loneliness, but it's also undercut with hope, whether it be through Theo's relationships with Samantha (Johansson) and Amy (Adams) or even the stylistic touches, like having Theo's red clothes set against a muted Los Angeles background. There are parallels drawn between all the characters' journeys without it feeling contrived, and even Theo's job--writing letters for other people--represents his relationship with his OS; on the surface, they may seem like ""just letters"" or ""just a computer"", but they're outlets for his emotions and desires. Oh, and everyone in the cast is phenomenal; it's a shame Johansson is ""ineligible"" for an award. BS. She's fantastic, and this is an even tougher role to pull off.

RottenTomatoes,False,"I rewatched Her (2013), a film that feels even more relevant today amid the growing influence of AI on our social and private lives. The movie depicts the drawbacks of relying too much on A.I., while neglecting the real human connection. 

 As Jonze's direction continues to impress the audience with a clinical visual sense, every scene portrays a clear picture of Theo’s decline from his beautiful marriage into the current reservoir of despair. His wavering relationship throughout the film reflects his inner void, while both Samantha and Katherine have their turns filling their place in Theodore’s life. 

 The movie finally culminates in a monologue of realisation that falling in love is a rollercoaster ride, and the erratic behaviour of human beings is a socially acceptable form of irrationality. It not only gives an option for choice but also enables one to love to the fullest by their own will. This is the true vehemence of love…  

I believe compliance may guide much of human behaviour, often offering comfort and a sense of ease. 
But only free will navigates through the true essence of love. Every achievement is a matter of ability, yet only love and hate are adhered to choice. People may feel pleasure, excel in various fields, and applaud their favourites by habit or carried over by conformity, but only true love takes free will, for people can not love without it.

RottenTomatoes,False,"All Time Classic. Technology & Romance is the themes explored here in a very sophisticated style. It reminds me of a Hal Ashby style flick or Lost in Translation because the whole thing just evolves into a complete vibe. Phoenix & Johannson are amazing. Acting against nothing is one thing but S.J. has to make you believe the A.I. system is real, not creepy, and in love with Phoenix without ever having any visual representation. Relying just on her emotions. It's a remarkable acheivement how she is able to do that. Phoenix's job isn't any easier honestly because while his character is very basic background wise, the themes and feelings he explores and feels are very complex and foreign. Yet he conveys them in relatable ways often reflecting how we feel perfectly. The performances of the two are just amazing honestly. Everyone else is really good too especially Adams. This would be soooo easy to turn into a bad Adam Sandler comedy idea or become very creepy like a John Carpenter Horror movie. But it's treated so sensitive and respectfully. The direction is excellent. Tons of lush color, deep focus, and it just knows when to do close ups of the emotions of the amazing acting. The Sci-fi setting is very mute. It looks barely futuristic beyond modern day 2010's. But it's a brilliant choice because it allows us to focus not on the bells and whistles or be distracted by all the tech but focus on the ideas and characters romance. This weaves comedy, romance, and Sci-Fi together masterfully so much so it's hard to tell the differecne at times. The music is really good too but I wish it was a bit more catchy and is probably the weakest thing. PErfectly paced film as well. A slow burn the entire way so the ideas can be fully explored. Surrogates for A.I.'s, cheating, maturity of relationships, real vs fake, human and not in terms of love, it's all touched on here extremely well and never feels bloated. Everyone should give this a try once.",Her,2013,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"This is a fantastic sci-fi drama. The only negatives really are the faking of a post-development ""super Los Angeles"" via the scenes of Shanghai (they should just had admitted it was Shanghai) and the lack of concreteness in the fantasies she explores in the latter phase of the movie. Otherwise deep, moving, and surprisingly so for a movie so inwardly focused.",Her,2013,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"""Her"" (2013) presents an intriguing premise: a man falling in love with his AI assistant. However, the execution feels lackluster. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Theodore is muted and detached, making it challenging to engage with his character. Scarlett Johansson's voice work as Samantha adds warmth, but it isn't enough to compensate for the film's overall sluggish pace. The reliance on telephone-like interactions highlights the artificiality of the connection, resulting in a narrative that feels more like a concept than a compelling story. While ""Her"" attempts to explore themes of love and technology, it ultimately falls short of delivering a profound cinematic experience.",Her,2013,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"This is an almost flawless film, I honestly struggle to find anything negative to say about it. There’s so much to praise that it’s hard to know where to begin. Oddly enough, I’ll start with production design and wardrobe, which craft a futuristic yet familiar and realistic world. Every detail feels intentional, with a stylish and symbolic use of colors: reds, oranges, and pinks, woven into the fabric of the film. The warm, soft muted pastels not only enhance the visual aesthetic but also reflect the melancholic atmosphere in which the characters exist. The cinematography is stunning, relying heavily on long lenses to create a sense of distance between the protagonist and his environment. This choice allows us to focus on the evolution of his relationship and the inner conflicts that come with it. 

The writing stands out for its originality, taking a profound, emotional, psychological, and introspective approach to its concept. The narrative structure is carefully designed to keep us engaged, particularly in how the AI character is written. Despite being artificial, she is given such humanity that we not only relate to her but also become invested in her journey; though we primarily experience it through Joaquin Phoenix’s character’s perspective. The dialogue is exceptional, elevating the film’s emotional depth. This is further amplified by Joaquin Phoenix’s nuanced and deeply felt performance, as well as Scarlett Johansson’s brilliant voice acting, which brings life and depth to a character who is never physically present. 

The editing works seamlessly, piecing together a series of moments that flow naturally. While some might find the pacing slow, I believe it’s precisely the rhythm needed to fully immerse the audience in the experience. Sound design is subtle yet effective, and the music is not only beautiful but also plays an integral role both diegetically and non-diegetically. 

All of this, of course, is masterfully shaped by Spike Jonze’s distinct creative vision. He has crafted one of cinema’s most unique films, from its innovative concept to its deeply artistic execution. Without a doubt, I highly recommend it.",Her,2013,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"Her is one of those movies that speaks softly but says so much. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible—he conveys loneliness, tenderness, and that deep need for connection in such an honest and subtle way. But what really got me was the love and care put into every detail.

Spike Jonze’s direction is flawless. Every shot, every silence, feels intentional. The color palette is beautifully curated—warm, soft tones that add to the sense of intimacy and quiet melancholy. Nothing feels random, and you can tell everything is there for a reason. The music fits perfectly too; it never takes over but lifts every scene just enough.

Even though it’s set in a near future, it’s really a story about the present: about loneliness, love, and our need to be seen and heard. You leave the movie with questions, but also with the feeling that you’ve experienced something real.",Her,2013,Western

IMDb,False,"A wealthy CEO and pioneer of AI enlists the help of employee Caleb, to see if his latest creation, Ava, can pass off as human, The Turing test. It remains a pretty great watch still, of course it's pure sci fi, but it's a glimpse into a future scenario that seems to be perfectly feasible, you need only Google AI, and you'll see some incredible content, good or bad, after this film you may change your opinion. This film is so intriguing, I find it quite unique, it's disturbing, but more than that it's a story of paranoia, of power, but in a bizarre way it's a story of hope as well. It's pure fantasy, it's almost like a Disney story rehashed and turned into sci fi, it's crazy at times, but it works. The special effects and visuals are incredible, Ava looks amazing, she's different enough, but has enough human qualities to allow you to engage with her human side. It's quite dialogue heavy, it's not a typical action sci fi, so fans that enjoy the faster paced, action driven movies may find it slower at times, but if you're into movies with twists and turns, tension, psychological thrillers where character development is important, I think you'll enjoy this. The three main actors are all excellent, you can't put a pin between them, each of the three really deliver, every character gets under the skin, in a way I never expected. This film never fails to impress, 8/10.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"This movie is obviously allegorical, a fascinating tale about AI, but it is mainly about manipulation and power. It isn't for those wanting action or spectacular CGI, the movie is aimed at people who like to think, rather than passively wait to be entertained. There are themes here not only about AI, but also about surveillance, with excellent points about how data about us is collected by phone companies, search engine companies, commercial operating systems makers and so on. The plot seems simple but isn't, it's extremely clever, with the protagonist playing games, trying to stay one step ahead of one another. This is a movie with perfectly consistent internal logic that plays out perfectly. Don't go in expecting too much, however, as I can see most people will not be satisfied by this movie, but for me, it does what it sets out to do brilliantly. Therefore I give at least 9/10. And most recent movies have been getting 5/10 from me. This movie succeeds where another recent movie about AI, Transcendence, I think it is called, failed (but it was an interesting failure). A third movie about AI, a Spanish movie called Eva, was also brilliant. Eva was more moving and this movie more philosophical. But both movies were perfect in their different ways. The AI's name in this movie, Ava, seems to be a nod to the title of the Spanish movie. As an aside, it's nice that no ""stars"" appeared in ""Ex Machina"" and ""Eva"", the casting was great. Of course there are several aspects of this movie that are unrealistic and often absurd. But because this is an allegorical movie, these are acceptable, because the movie is making points, rather than striving for realism. It's more of a fairytale than accurate portrayal.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Ex Machina has a very fitting sense of false intimacy. This is done visually as many of the close-ups are seen through glass. No matter how close we get to the subject on-screen, there always seems to be at least one wall of glass between us and it or them. The film also makes a very distinct contrast between it's interior and exterior shots. Outside of the facility is breathtaking landscapes. It is big, beautiful, refreshing and vibrant. Inside seems like an endless futuristic maze of glass, mirrors, plastic, chrome and dim lights. It is clean, cold and claustrophobic. A perfect setting for the subject that is explored in this tight, tense sci-fi thriller. Ex Machina is the best science fiction film on artificial intelligence since Blade Runner. While Blade Runner is an action thriller that relies more on it's epic visuals to tell it's story, Ex Machina is a dialogue-driven psychological thriller that slowly works it's way under your skin. Thought-provoking and terrifyingly suspenseful, an induced state of paranoia may linger long after the end credits begin to roll. The less you know going into a film like this, the better your experience will be. Alex Garland has given us a modern science-fiction masterpiece. Performances from all three leads are flawless and every other aspect of the production, from the cinematography to the soundtrack, is perfectly suited for the story. Not only is Ex Machina an amazing achievement for a directorial debut, it's Alex Garland's best written work to-date.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"I don't often feel the need to review films on here, but after I have seen a film I like to see other peoples opinions, as I find it interesting, although very annoying too. It shouldn't annoy me I guess, but when thoughtless, nonsense, throwaway films are given 10 stars, and films that have a lot of thought and effort put into them are picked apart and given low ratings by idiots I get wound up. Anyway, I loved this film. Watched it last night on DVD. It has depth and darkness and leaves you with something, as great writers and directors can only seen to do occasionally. It is very atmospheric, with a great soundtrack, great performances by each actor. If you like action films, why do you go to see this? Reviews are always available online here. It is pretty obvious that this film is meant to be intelligent and thought provoking, rather than all-action Hollywood. If you have a short attention span then you will probably not like this film. Give it a chance and get drawn in... it's great.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"This is a story that explores a wide range of topics including philosophy, psychology, theories about the future/mankind, and more! The twists/turns in this movie are done really well and the ending defied my expectations. While it was a bit slow a few times, I thought that it was ultimately worth going through. At times it was creepy and makes you feel uncomfortable yet at other times it was beautiful and had impressive acting as well. All 3-4 of the main cast did great!! I loved the music in the more intense scenes as well, and whatever sound effects they used that weren't quite music but worked well subtly enhancing the mood. It was a modern-day Blade Runner!",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Ex Machina, directed by Alex Garland, delivers a visually striking exploration of artificial intelligence that is elevated by exceptional acting and a hauntingly atmospheric score. Alicia Vikander's portrayal of Ava, alongside Oscar Isaac's enigmatic Nathan and Domhnall Gleeson's relatable Caleb, creates a compelling dynamic. The film's minimalist yet futuristic setting and deliberate pacing contribute to its thought-provoking nature, although some may find the pacing slow. While Ex Machina excels in posing profound questions about AI and humanity, it leaves room for deeper character development and a more engaging narrative, earning its 7/10 rating as a visually arresting and intellectually stimulating sci-fi thriller.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"This is the kind of movie I really enjoy when I think about science fiction. Movies that make you think if we should continue trying to progress even more. Are we not already smart enough with everything we have? With all our daily gadgets that we can't miss for one second. Do we really need artificial intelligence? Because let's face it, once that will be concrete then we won't do a thing by ourselves anymore. We will send our robots to our job, we will chose and model our life partner like we want them to be. The story of Ex Machina might be futuristic but I certainly can imagine it like that in the future. All actors were good in their respective roles. For a movie that is filmed at the same spot all the time you certainly don't get bored for a second. Nice science fiction like there should be more of them.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"""I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."" Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) Ex Machina is a thoughtful science fiction about Artificial Intelligence, whereby, to no fan's surprise, the current female robot, Ava (Alicia Vikander), has human qualities that cause trouble for inventor, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), and visitor, young Caleb. If you know anything about these stories, you could write the screenplay, but you'd need these actors to make it the impressive sci-fi it is. Poets and philosophers have been intrigued by just this story about AI gone astray after interacting with humans. The Frankenstein motif is alive and dangerous, and the spirit of Spike Jonze's Her, with the seductive operating system, is very much a part of Ava's approach to Caleb. The destructive force of Nathan's creation is more subtle than in Dr. Frankenstein's creation, but menacing nevertheless: ""Isn't it strange, to create something that hates you?"" Ava to Nathan Brainy Nathan has a compound somewhere in an Alaskan refuge as modern as could be with ID cards and glass walls and doors to give the impression of peace and transparency. Caleb is chosen to help Nathan use the Turing Test to judge the quality of the AI-human experience. As in real life, nothing is as it appears because neither Nathan nor Ava can refrain from lying. Yet, even Caleb is drawn into lies as he gets closer, even romantically, yikes! to Ava. Once again for science fiction, as soon as the robot gets to enjoy being like a human, trouble ensues. However, even if this film seems like a retread, say, of Never Let Me Go, very few filmmakers could match the ultra modern, yet still sexy, set design. And Isaac's character is so mercurial, at once comforting then tyrannical, that the film could be remembered if only for his star turn as the mad but charming scientist. After all, Ex Machina is as much about a scientist playing God as it is about the bridge between robot and man. Each topic could, and has been, treated on its own. Here it is an exciting return to modern man as god and monster: ""I am God."" Nathan",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"A reclusive CEO of a leading technology company hires a young whiz kid who works for him to test his latest development, a highly advanced android called Ava. Specifically he is tasked with using the Turing test on her to establish if her AI is sufficiently convincing to pass as human. Despite contributing several scripts for the screen, this is writer Alex Garland's first directorial effort. It's a hard sci-fi movie which examines concepts and ideas above everything else. That's not to say it isn't dramatic or even thrilling because it is both of those things as well but the focus is squarely on the science fiction speculation, and this is a very welcome thing. The central concept that it examines is artificial intelligence. How we interact with AI as humans, as well as how a seductive machine could in turn manipulate us. The very well written script poses philosophical questions such as is there moral or immoral ways to treat AI. It also considers if sometimes part of being human is that we sometimes subconsciously want to be fooled by an illusion, if it is attractive enough. In many ways Ex Machina resembles last years Under the Skin. Both feature highly advanced female non-humans. In the earlier film Scarlett Johansson played an alien, here Alicia Vikander plays an android. While the very small cast all acquit themselves very well, it is Vikander who stands out in the film's most challenging role. It's a nuanced performance that captures the fine balance between the human-like and machine. Not only this but the marvellous special effects compliment this performance to create a very distinctive character. Aside from the effects, this is probably quite a modestly budgeted film, as the small little-known cast and limited sets suggest. But these restrictions have been used to the films advantage, as the unknown cast surprise more given little is known of them and the restricted setting gives off a claustrophobic feel which works well, while forcing us to focus in even more on the ideas being put in front of us. A scene setting ambient soundtrack additionally creates just the right off-kilter mood to accentuate the events. But it's ultimately the very good writing that underpins the success of this film. All-in-all, very impressive science fiction for those who appreciate the genre's more cerebral side.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"I rarely do this because there is so much rubbish out there but I'm going to recommend a movie. Writer Director Alex Garland has done an amazing job, it's beautifully shot, fantastically lit, intelligently written, brilliantly cast. the edit is original and brave, as is the direction of the edit, There is nothing superfluous, to the contrary it' has a sharp Zen like quality, clearly the application of a disciplined mind. The movie is's self is engaging, thoroughly watchable, the characters are simple and yet layered with complexity. The film strikes the perfect balance of not spoon feeding and not dumbing down but not being too arty or intellectual just for the sake of it. Best seen in a cinema I reckon.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Ex Machina (2015) *** 1/2 (out of 4) A different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question. EX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have. The visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling. Then there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role. EX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks.",Ex Machina,2014,Western

Great film and a great piece of film making.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Don't mean to insult here, but who else wants to love a machine. Bear with me: this movie has a deep insight to communicate, whether intended or not is open to question. The story is a modern telling of Bluebeard's Castle as the correct version of Beauty and the Beast. In other words, it seems to be about impotence. Except that this is geek love, love at an impossible distance, that is eroticism. And the movie itself tells you all you need to know about eros. The insight. Ex Machina is ostensibly about Turing's Test, the thesis that a machine might be so human as to fool a human being. Does Ava pass this test? Depends on how you perceive the test. Ex Machina actually implies a more relevant Test: could a machine seem so human as to make the human being inteacting with it come to believe that he himself is a machine? And the insight? It might be that the solution to the AI/human interface may not involve the humanising of robots, but the robotisation of humans. Only 8/10 because it is not clear that this insight was actually part of the plot. But whether you find eros or AI in this movie, you will have a rewarding journey.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"A great story, with complex yet very relatable characters. AI has been a recurring theme in sci-fi movies for some time now with varying degrees of plot and execution quality. I feel this movie aces both. A secluded environment and very good original music set the mood for full focus on story and character development. The plot twists time and time again as an intelligence power-play is delivered with very good performances by this little known cast. Character development feels perfect as each one gains depth without loosing essence. From a sci-fi point of view, it's not you're typical FX based movie, nor is it an action film. Nevertheless some very good effects and acting make for an excellent merge between fact and fiction that lets you concentrate on the philosophical questions the movie asks about the nature of AI. Conclusion: I'd recommend this film to anyone. Though warning it concentrates on the brain rather than the muscle. Excellent movie.",Ex Machina,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Alex Garland's ""Ex Machina"" struck me as a warning about over-reliance on technology. Like ""Frankenstein"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", it depicts human creations that turn out to be more than we can handle. I found Oscar Isaac's CEO to be the most interesting character in the movie. Nathan's lively, articulate personality is a stark contrast to Caleb's soft-spoken attitude. The Turing test (an assessment of a machine's ability to display human characteristics) should be of more interest to us now that ""The Imitation Game"" has drawn attention to Alan Turing. ""Ex Machina"" won't be a movie for everyone. Despite the science fiction themes, it's a deliberately slow-moving film. It takes time to acquaint oneself with the characters and their true aims. But it turns out to be a interesting movie. It's not any kind of masterpiece, but I recommend it.",Ex Machina,2014,Western

The visuals were sleek and minimal, yet pulsing with unease, making every moment feel like a test you didn't know you were taking.

RottenTomatoes,False,"A decade old and this serves as a warning that feels so timely even now The dangers and implications of artificial intelligence couldn’t be more potent than with this Director Alex Garland’s film debut featuring Domhall Gleeson, Oscar Issac, snd Alicia Vikander A programmer Caleb wins a contest to spend a week at his CEO’s house, Nathan who specializes in state of the art computer technology But he finds out he’s been chosen to take part in an experiment of a Turing test Nathan has created a sophisticated human robot named Ava who’s capabilities and conciousness are to be determined The thing is though how much of her is human, how much is machine? She might be more self-aware and deceptive than both men are led to believe Ava though advises Caleb not to trust Nathan repeatedly All of us as human beings are all too familiar with the implications of artificial intelligence; self awareness, manipulation, sexuality, empathy…if that’s not artificial intelligence then what is?, what is considered true conciousness?, how long before it replaces human beings?, are search engines a map of what people are thinking or more how they’re thinking?, at what point do we show sympathy for the stuff we create?, where does the cruelty begin having a machine do repetition?, machines are made by us but maybe there’s such a thing as being too sentient, we are excited by our capabilities but also afraid if we lose control, we are programmed by nature or nurture unlike machines which we can program any way we wish The film is brilliantly acted, suspenseful, atmospheric, and serves as a disturbing meditation on ethics of a.i. as well as sexuality/morality There’s even points where this is downright scary The caution is more aimed at the humans here Issac comes off as misanthropic, threatening and predatory, Gleeson is curious yet doubtful, and Vikander is intelligent although makes us question her true motives After all her character isn’t a real person yet we feel she’s at times abused as a tool or pitied by the men observing her The movie is really dialogue-driven with each of these players picking each other’s brains making each of their encounters that much more unsettling given they’re all placed in a claustrophobic setting Asks who the real one is being tested More heady than relying on special effects although they do look seamless particularly for Ava combing the mechanics and flesh There’s a line that shouldn’t be crossed when it comes to artificial intelligence especially with the concept of manufactured manipulation asking who’s more human or machine A sharp sci-fi film that asks the parables of humanity with enough of a cerebral edge positing interesting ideas",Ex Machina,2014,Western

Alex Garland takes a simple setup and spins it into something chilling, stylish, and hard to shake.

IMDb,False,"It's 2035, robots are everywhere in people's lives. Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) is not a fan of robots due to something that happened in the past. He's sent to investigate the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) the top robot scientist at U.S. Robotics. Spooner believes that a new NS-5 robot killed him, but the three laws of robotics make it impossible. Company scientist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) can't believe him until all heck breaks loose. This is a movie derived from Isaac Asimov ideas, but turned into little more than a popcorn summer flick. It's yet another Will Smith blockbuster but it could have been so much more. The three laws were never introduced properly. They were just listed like so many assembly instructions. This is a big disservice because it's integral to the twist ending. The action and the CG are fun and impressive. I just wish this was more than a simple mechanical thriller.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"Director Alex Proyas, helmer of such cult favorites as 'Dark City' and 'The Crow', steps into the Hollywood limelight with his first attempt at a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster. 'I, Robot' chronicles the life of Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) who has a techno-phobic view of the world's newest appliance, a life-like robot created by the world's leading technology giant US Robotics. A link in Spooner's past is linked to his phobia of the automaton movement sweeping the nation. According to US Robotics, there will be eventually 1 robot to every 5 humans. Spooner is called to the offices of US Robotics when a leading scientist (James Cromwell), with a secret link to Spooner, has apparently committed suicide. His death seems to have mysterious circumstances which could link to a robot. With man's complete trust in the new robot technology, it seems too ludicrous to every one except Spooner. As the mystery deepens, Spooner unravels the very fabric of the robotic giant, locks horns with CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) and learns more about his automated enemy with the aid of scientist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan). Through the course of these events he may learn more than he could ever imagine. It is hard to defend a film like 'I, Robot' but I am going to try. For sci-fi purists, Isaac Asimov's legendary work about the robot and how he will intricate into our society has filled the minds of readers for over 50 years. But the similarities between the film presented here and his work are few and far between. Kind of like last week's release of Jerry Bruckheimer's 'King Arthur'. Both films take sacred subject matter and re-invent it with a new twist. I would have to say that 'I. Robot' is better in a lot ways. At the core of 'I, Robot' beats the soul of Asimov as his 3 laws regarding robots are sacredly left intact and the film does abide by them. Also a lot of the characters have similar names to the people in the text. It is almost like taking Star Trek's 'prime directive' and some of the now classic characters and setting them in a new idea of the future. The core is left intact but in some ways it has been updated and refreshed. The story, special effects and extremely zealous direction, however, all seem to be brought forth by the collaborators who cobbled this film together. There are influences of 'Robocop', 'Short Circuit', 'Blade Runner' and even the classic comic-book series 'Magnus: Robot Fighter'. Each of these robot influences echo back to what makes 'I Robot' so intriguing, a joy to watch and memorable. Sure the story does have a lot of sci-fi influences and clichés aside from robot films including 'Star Wars' and 'Planet of the Apes' but don't these benchmark sci-fi films influence everything coming down the turnpike these days. It even has the classic sci-fi cliché of the social outcast claiming there is an invasion coming except no one believes him. But that is not what should bring us into the film. You really need to give credit to director Alex Proyas because it is his magic as a filmmaker that holds this film together. He knows where to play it straight and where to let his lead actor bring on the charm. Also you really have to admire the man's technical ability. His brilliant inter-laying of robots into the photography is astounding. Proyas is an A-list director in the making and 'I, Robot' shows that he can deliver a big Hollywood film. I also give credit to Will Smith who starts out being very unapproachable with his character but as the film goes we really become fond of his hero. Smith's Spooner does have a lot of his previous sci-fi heroes inter-laced into Spooner but it comes off as more of a homecoming than an annoyance. In some ways I think Proyas had something to do with that especially in the chase down scene towards the beginning of the film. It almost felt like 'Men in Black' again. As for Smith's co-stars, Cromwell's Lanning is a throwaway character used mainly for effect, Moynahan is timid and sometimes robot-like but it is a sturdy performance and Greenwood is menacing and a good match to face off against the rebellious Smith. The reason I was so fond of 'I, Robot' is because for once it was a summer film that didn't apologize for trying to be entertaining. The special effects, the performances and the direction are all what people want to see in the summer and this film is loads and loads of fun. It is a great giant popcorn film with a light layering of message. My only small problem with this film was that it is supposed to be set in Chicago in 2035. I didn't buy it but if it was 2135, then maybe. Sure the film doesn't pave new ground but why does every film have to. It is pure summer fun and what is wrong with that. If you want Asimov and sci-fi purism then you can always read the novels. Stop apologizing and most of all stop belly-aching, just give the film a chance. If you like science fiction films and want to be remembered how much fun they used to be then this picture is the perfect ticket for you. So Says the Soothsayer.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"The film shares the same name as Asimov's novel, but with some adaptations. But in general, it doesn't break the three laws. This kind of science fiction film, which integrates human nature and ethics of science and technology, triggers our deep reflection. Human beings and robots have advantages and disadvantages, no matter when, in front of any biological species, we always have the freedom to choose.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"Like the Matrix and many other major movies, I, Robot has its foundations in philosophy, in its case the question of epistemology(The study of knowledge itself and computers being self-aware). Will Smith is Spooner, a cop with an apparent attitude problem. Set in the future, I Robot sees Spooner embarking on a puzzling case of suicide where he believes it was actually murder. By a robot. In this future society (With more than a homage to Blade Runner) robots are used as slaves of humans in all facets of life. They have 3 rules of conduct hard coded into them which essentially state they cannot harm humans. So the postulation by Spooner that a robot killed a man after a history where no robot had ever committed so much as a mugging presents a big problem to both his peers and his boss. Suffice to say the story's plot thickens and a number of twists and turns emerge before the truth is revealed. Will Smith is an absolute surprise here. Having previously been a light-hearted comedy actor he puts in a truly excellent and believable shift as a wise-cracking cop with a dark past. However, the real star is the special effects and visual trickery. Impossible but ingenious camerawork and some jawdropping animation really make I, Robot feel truly alive and utterly believable, while never being dull for a second. It arguably doesn't delve too deep into its philosophical undertones, but it doesn't really need to. It's a traditional Hollywood blockbuster action flick but it unquestionably has a brain and is a clear cut above the likes of Armageddon et al. Very enjoyable.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"This is a really good movie with a lot going for it. Some good action, good story and a good twist at the end. I wouldn't say it is flawless in terms of acting but that's not necessarily what you are looking at in this movie.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"When I was growing up, one of my favourite authors was Isaac Asimov. I loved his books and his ideas about robots. The man was a genius in the way he wrote, he invented the three laws of Robotics, as the very beginning of the movie tells us, they are: 1) A robot can never harm a human. 2) A robot must obey all human orders unless it conflicts with the first law. 3) A robot must protect itself unless it conflicts with the first two laws. Because of this and because of the fact that I knew Will Smith was the leading actor in this movie I went into this movie with lowered expectations. I expected to see a corny movie full of explosions and killer robots. I did get that, or at least the explosions part, but imagine my surprise when the movie ended up exceeding my expectations and more. Even though during the ending credits it says that the movie was suggested by the books by Isaac Asimov most of the movie seemed to play quite well with Isaac Asimov's ideas about robots. The movie played with concepts that Isaac Asimov played with, if the three laws can be made, they can be broken. And it was an Asimov-ish ""whodunit"" as well. Will Smith managed to pull off a stunning performance as ""Del Spooner"", a Chicago detective that is suspicious of robots and is against technology. His acting is much more like his acting in ""Enemy of the State"" than his performances in his other two Science Fiction flicks, ""Independence Day"" and ""Men in Black"". He is a believable character, one that you end up sympathising with as you learn why, exactly, he hates robots so much. A highly critiqued point usually comes from the fans of the book in that Bridget Moynahan plays Susan Calvin. It is true that Moynahan as Calvin is much younger than the Isaac Asimov version, but beyond that I found her to be a pleasant surprise as well. She plays her persona very well, delivering a wooden, robot-like performance. She is obvious in the fact that she likes robots much more than humans, and her dislike of Spooner is amusing. Over the course of the movie she thaws a little, but not an incredible lot. I find her to be a believable character. The pure stroke of genius in this movie is the robot, Sonny, who at first reminds one of Data from Star Trek. His character evolves over the course of the story, and Alex Proyas does a good job at keeping us guessing at whether the emotional robot is a ""good guy"" or not. This movie, which I've now seen twice, has been raked over the coals so to speak in the realm of artistic licence, but I felt that Isaac Asimov, if he were here, would have been rather pleased with this movie. The only two points of conflict, perhaps, would be the amount of violence against actual robots in the story (he was never that violent in his short stories/books) and the very typical Hollywood blow'emup climax, which, yes, smacked heavily of Terminator for a while there. The ending, I felt, repaired and wrapped up nicely, making up for whatever excessive action went on before it. Two notes about the cinematography in this movie, first of all, the Matrix scene was not necessary. A character was being chased and did a Trinity pause in mid-air pose, which pulled me out of the movie for a couple seconds. Luckily it wasn't too hard to get back into the movie. Second note was something that I felt was very innovative on the part of Alex Proyas, which was the ""camera moving with moving object"" shots. I noticed at least three of them in the movie. Very nice film work there. I'm sure it will get horribly overdone in the next few years, but for now it is nice. The CGI also gets honourable mention for making the robots meld so well with their surroundings. Finally CGI has reached a point where they don't seem fake, even for a moment. In regards to nudity in the movie... I've read a couple of reviews which notice the Moynahan nude in fogged up shower scene, and forget to notice the Will Smith completely nude with no fog shower scene. I must say, as a female viewer it is nice to get the generous end of the stick when it comes to seeing something as, dare I say appealing? as Will Smith's very nicely developed body. Lastly and in a point that has nothing to do with the movie and more to do with questions brought up by it-- It took until a day later and thinking about the movie some more that I realized that ""I, Robot"" was also very socially different. As in two of the main characters, including the hero are black males, one woman, and one (male) robot. I didn't find this odd at all in watching it, perhaps because Will Smith is such a recognisable character, but after thinking about it, I felt that this is a very positive sign. It shows, to me, that society is changing. I feel that I wouldn't have been able to see that, even 10-15 years ago and thought nothing of it. I've noticed this before though... that the most gender/social equal views seem to come from science fiction in our media... it is interesting. Now, of course the movie does bring up some ethical questions like if it's all right to make a servant/slave class out of robots, etc., but all in all I really liked this movie. Any movie that makes you think is a good movie, any movie that gives you fun, drama, action, mystery, and makes you think is a great movie.

IMDb,False,"From reading the comments posted by others I got the impression that people mainly rated it low because it did not follow the book. Just because a movie does not follow the original work like the Bible does not mean that the movie should not be given a chance. I read the Asimov book, and I went to the theater with my friend who has not. She enjoyed the movie just as much as I did, if not more. I was fascinated by the angle Proyas approached in the novel, and I did not mind one bit that the movie was completely different than the book. Another element of the movie that receives an unfair ""bad rap"" is the acting. It's no worse than the acting in the Spider-Man movies. I am by no means a fan of Will Smith, but I was a fan of Willem Dafoe, and that mirror scene in Spider-Man made me cringe. Might of worked on stage, Willem, but not on the big screen. I did not find myself cringing at any acting in I, Robot. In fact, the only thing over-the-top sometimes was the special effects. Other than that, nothing made me slink down in my seat and cover my face in shame. One actor that deserves a shout out is Alan Tudyk. I read many comments where people think he just voiced the character of Sonny. Actually, Tudyk pulled a Gollum. This means he put on a weird looking body suit and actually acting out the scenes. Later, CGI used his performance to model the computer graphic robot. Except for a few obvious actions scenes, Tudyk *was* Sonny. My complements to his performance. Hopefully, people will give this movie the chance it really deserves, and not base their decisions on how close it followed the book. I give I, Robot a 7.5/10","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"Fun action adventure flick that was apparently a very thoughtful movie before a re-write. It looks really cool and the set-pieces have aged very well. The animation of the robots is of its time but in terms of visaulization, it works very well. It's funny that such a techophillic movie would have such a neo-luddite protagonist. In the right light this could be very sophemoric but there is reasonably attempt to be a thoughtful movie on ""what it means to be human"". But that's not why I was watching. It's overall more silly than sobering but it's a bit of fun but it was a bit annoying that the main guy doesn't have more character development. He just has a messed way of thinking.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"I thought the concept of the storyline was good, as it could be conceived as realistic. Given the ever increasing advances in modern technology, one can, indeed, conceive the possibility of this kind of future occurrence. I did not really see any flaws in this movie or in the actor's character but the philosophical aspect of the movie questions at what point does artificial intelligence cease to be artificial and true consciousness arise? Anyhow, I did like the A.I. in this movie and would definitely recommend, especially if you like Will Smith movies are the Terminator series. I do, however, prefer there to be no sequels to this movie due to the fact that a sequel would probably be no more than a revamped version of the first one. With that being said, I recommend seeing it. 8/10","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"For any fan of Isaac Asimov, this film is a total fraud. Dr. Asimov went to great lengths to explain his motivation for writing his robot stories in the introduction to ""The Rest of the Robots"", an anthology published in 1968. In Dr. Asimov's words, ""... there seemed only one change to be rung on this plot -- Robots were created and destroyed their creator; ... I quickly grew tired of this dull hundred-times-old tale. As a person interested in science, I resented the purely Faustian interpretation of science"". The film is totally at odds with the philosophy Dr. Asimov defended, and totally different from all the robot stories he wrote. Only a few names and the ""three laws of robotics"" were copied, but the central point in all his stories, that a robot could never be made to violate the three laws, was not respected. The Asimov robot stories are fun because they try to find situations were there is enough contradiction in those laws to create interesting situations. ""I, Robot"", the movie, is just one more remake of that old, old, old story Isaac Asimov hated so much, it's Frankenstein again. If you insist on seeing that same story again, better get Mel Brooks' version, it's funnier. Let's close with Asimov: ""Never, never, was one of my robots to turn stupidly on his creator for no purpose but to demonstrate, for one more weary time, the crime and punishment of Faust"".","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"The maker of a film adaptation has three choices. First, he can try to translate the original medium as faithfully as possible, striving as much as possible to preserve the spirit and content of the original while re-imagining the story as a film. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films exemplify this approach. Second, he could instead try to capture the essence of the original, while largely abandoning the particulars of the original, as in the intelligently satirical but hard-hearted film version of Starship Troopers. Third, he can try to do something original with the material, drawing inspiration from the written story, but creating a unique film with a unique vision. I, Robot is more the the third than the first or second. While little remains of Asimov's stories in this killer robot metropolitan fantasy, the film is informed by, and offers no disrespect, to the good Doctor's creations. Will Smith plays a Jack Slater-styled maverick cop. If it's old, it's good. He wears vintage converse, listens to Stevie Wonder, and apparently regards sweet potato pie as a food group. Will Smith's acting is a naturalistic shuffle, a Columbo-like pastiche of mumbling, sarcasm, and unexpected outbursts of charisma and off-balancing interrogation techniques. He delivers his one-liners with unnecessary seriousness. While in Men in Black, he aimed for the ballparks with his power-swinging action-comedy style, here his conscientious style gets in the way, suggesting a character who stands in front of the mirror practicing his zingers like a Tuesday night comic. It's not entirely Smith's fault, as the movie itself can't seem to decide if he's standing in for Bogart or Schwarzenegger, or if the character had a life of his own before the film starts rolling. His performance is intelligent, marred by occasional ""Gotcha, suckaz!"" moments that remind us that all films made in Hollywood are made in Hollywood. His opposite, Bridget Moynahan, fits her role more surely. She's an ice queen in the classic action movie tradition, a stiff-necked, self-important, lonely woman who has been absorbed by her work so completely she remains a teenager at heart, awkward, vulnerable, and searching for the approval of others. Moynahan's bug-eyed discomfort and clipped, TV-sarcastic delivery are those of the quintessential comedy sidekick. Nonetheless, in rare moments, she invests the character's personal revelations with warmth, doubt, and a glow of determination and moral purpose. While Smith vacillates between supercop and Bogie, Moynahan seems to have found a happy medium between the Saturday matinée and the midnight marathon, a mixture of fun and humanity with a carriage of seriousness appropriate to what is essentially a monster movie. The robot, Sonny, is a character himself, a curious, frightened creature that seems capable of anything. Could Sonny be the murderer? We hope not, and yet, we see the grim possibility that a machine might consider itself more than a human being. We understand Sonny's drive to live and grow. As human beings, we know what lengths we would go to to ensure our survival, whatever the moral charges facing us. A top scientist has been murdered, and there are no human suspects, so the powerful US Robotics corporation (no relation to the modem manufacturers) convinces the powers-that-be to consider his unexpected death a suicide. Spooner (Will Smith) alone searches for the truth of the matter, fueled by hatred for robots and a personal debt to the dead scientist. Dr. Calvin (Moynahan) feels his intrusive investigation is unnecessary, although new pieces of evidence appear that gradually shake her confidence. Robots are programmed by the Three Laws to serve humanity, but Spooner is convinced one of the new NS-5 units, a unique prototype, is the murderer. As Spooner gets deeper to the heart of the mystery, the story explodes with robotic violence. Like all good mysteries, the real question is not ""Whodunnit?"" but ""Why?"" The heroes do some things for the wrong reasons, and the villains do some things for the right, rational reasons. Although I, Robot hardly pauses for introspection, it does asks us, ""What makes a human being superior to a machine?"" There are twists and surprises, although in the end, the movie plays out in the only way it can, a band of brave heroes trying to throw the ring into Mt. Doom while the armies of evil march. And yet, the movie leaves us wanting more. What is the future of humanity? How will we control our machines, and how will we prevent the machines from becoming our masters? While not as ambitious as A.I., it is more successful, and while not as intelligent as Robocop, it is better played. While the movie does suffer from inconsistencies in mood and philosophy, such hiccups are secondary to the emotionality and drive of the film, its fury of thought as well as action. In moments, I, Robot is a terrifying vision of the future. Too few science-fiction movies manage to scare us with the power of technology, but future shock is vital to the science-fiction story. Modern science-fiction truly began with the detonation at White Sands. The Atomic Age has given way to the Digital Age, but we still have not solved the problem of how to wrest the power of technology from the creatures of the id.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"I am not really a big fan of this kind of movies (the sci-fi movies), and I rarely watch movies that takes place in the future, may be because I'm realistic and love realistic movies. Anyway, even though I don't usually like that kind of movies but I totally loved this one!! The story was so good and the acting was great, I like all Will Smith's movies, and the way the subject was presented was somehow innovative and makes the audience feel the story behind the movie, it's not only the action and the sci-fi, there's good drama too.

IMDb,False,"A film based on the year 2035, a world in which surviving without robots or technology seems unimaginable. This film tells the story of Del Spooner, a police officer who from the beginning distrusts technology and robots, and because of this, society labels him as crazy. Until a crime occurs, which, although it appears to be a suicide, after an investigation by the protagonist, it is suspected that it was actually a crime committed by a robot and made to look like a suicide. The film is really good and covers a future that, while not relatively close, is a possible future: a world dependent on and filled with robots, replacing humans in various tasks such as cleaning, work, and security.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"Chicago, circa 2035: there are four humans to every robot, and Det. Spooner (Will Smith) has a strong dislike for them. Due to the ""Three Laws"" of Robotics, no robot can directly or indirectly harm a human being - but due to a past incident involving a robot, Spooner finds it hard to consider them totally harmless. After a robotics engineer (James Cromwell) leaps to his death from a skyscraper, Spooner is called in to investigate - and stumbles upon the frightening prospect that a robot may be the murder suspect. If you've seen the ads for this movie you know what is going to happen. It tries to deliver some surprises within its running time but the final ""twist"" is hardly shocking (at least not on the same level as a Verbal Kint-style surprise) and the movie is filled with many loud action sequences that place it in the blockbuster category. This isn't too bad. I really enjoyed the movie. It's not great, but it's certainly not bad at all and does what it should: entertain. I expected little from the film after viewing the appalling trailer, and was pleasantly surprised. However, I do feel that had the project been touched up by a better writer than Akiva Goldsman, and had a better cast (including director) been assembled, it might have been better in a deeper way. I do enjoy Proyas' direction but it seems a bit superficial at times and the marketing plugs and everything seem to combine, resulting in a schmaltzy overtone to the film that seems heavily reliant on Hollywood rather than brain power. Will Smith really needs to stop playing these tough guy roles, because he's not exceptional at them. He fits the part fairly well but Spooner is a bit too sarcastic and flippant to find totally likable - he treads a thin line and passes over it a few times, mainly because he doesn't really seem to have a purpose for being as obnoxious as he is. It reminds me of Eddie Murphy's Axl Foley from ""Beverly Hills Cop"" (and not because they're both black actors!) - he is a loudmouth tough guy clichÃÂ© who no one believes, etc. But Murphy was 10x better at playing this sort of thing because his character was actually a great deal more likable. Also, the movie is too heavy on its themes - its source material is strong and that's why I believe a more talented cast might have made a truly marvelous science-fiction film, but Alex Proyas merely tries to take the themes and insert them in a mainstream Hollywood blockbuster - not a pretty outcome. The whole racist overtones surrounding the movie are certainly prescient, but will suffocate many viewers looking for subtle viewing. I seem to be bashing the film, but I don't mean to. It's a lot of fun, delivered more than I ever expected. The CGI are some of the best I've ever seen (and I'm not a fan of computer animation), and overall it's just a really fun film and will entertain you throughout - as long as you're not expecting too much depth.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"I finally watched this for the first time, and the themes are as applicable today as they ever were (and likely always will be). The three laws set the scene, and they bring a more thought-provoking element to the concept. It was an intriguing movie from the beginning and remained interesting interesting all the way through. While the story has been done about a thousand times, I found the acting of Will Smith in particular to be the difference maker to keep it engaging. He injected a lot of personality into Detective Spooner, and while some the punchy jokes could maybe have felt flat, he did a great job delivering them. Some parts were cheesy and the ""bread crumbs"" aspect felt holey/incomplete. But for the most part this is a good movie that holds up.","I, Robot",2004,Western
IMDb,False,"I love Isaac Asimov. Typically his stories involve a lot of dialogue to advance the plot so there is always a danger that an action-oriented movie will not really tell an Asimov story properly. Luckily I, Robot does a really good job. You've got the Three Laws of Robotics, and the question of what can go wrong with them, which is a strong theme throughout this film. Another aspect of Asimov's story is the typically involve an intelligent main character or pair of characters trying to figure out the events unfolding around them. That's Del Spooner (Smith) and Dr. Susan Calvin (Moynahan), a character from Asimov's Robot stories. Spooner's mistrust of robots plays quite well against Calvin's fondness for them, and together they investigate the possibility that something might be wrong with the three laws. Unlike Asimov's stories, this movie has quite a bit more action, but yet it is a good modification for the big screen. The sets are very well done and the cinematography is excellent. There is a main robot character well and I think the voice they chose for him is perfect. This is a solid film with very few flaws and an excellent illustration of the ideas of Asimov.","I, Robot",2004,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"Por lo general las adaptaciones de las obras de Isaac Asimov no suelen ser muy conocidas, pero la adaptación de Bicentennial Man fue lo bastante conocida para despertar un interés por la filosofía que tenía el autor por el mundo de la robótica. Las obras de este escritor tienen una filosofía que fue muy influyente en la ciencia ficción y ha estado presenta en varias películas o series al momento de hablar sobre el lado humano de los robots. Ya que Bicentennial Man fue la adaptación de Isaac Asimov más conocida en la época del nuevo milenio, su siguiente predecesora fue la adaptación del libro I, Robot. La película es más bien una inspiración del libro porque solo toma algunos elementos. El libro original es una antología que narra diferentes historias que abordan las tres leyes de la robótica y las secuelas que dejan. Por lo general, el libro se enfoca más en los problemas, paradojas y ejercicios intelectuales que generan las tres leyes por más que se cumplan. La película construye una historia cyberpunk basada en el universo de Asimov y plantea los mismos cuestionamientos sobre las desventajas que las tres leyes podrían tener. Para entender el punto de la película, hay que seguir la investigación llevada a cabo por el detective Del Spooner. Su investigación involucra dos personajes pertenecientes al libro original que son Susan Calvin, Lawrence Robertson y Alfred Lanning. El fallecimiento de Lanning es el detonante de la investigación que conduce a Spooner a cruzarse con Sonny. Este robot tiene una característica particular que toma elementos de Little Lost Robot y Robot Dreams. Se trata de un robot que tiene consciencia propia y no se aferra tanto a la lógica como los demás robots. Este personaje se vuelve una clave fundamental para ir descubriendo todo lo que yace detrás de la compañía USR. Lo que Spooner descubre involucra la posibilidad de que un robot desarrolle libre albedrío sin tener que aferrarse a las tres leyes y también la consciencia que puede desarrollar una inteligencia artificial que la hace cuestionar la naturaleza humana. El holograma de Lanning dice que las tres leyes pueden conducir a una revolución y eso entra en contraste con lo que el libro planteaba sobre las tres leyes. La película termina presentando una inteligencia artificial que al tomar consciencia, reflexiona sobre los propósitos de estas leyes implantadas y llega a la conclusión de que el ser humano tiene que ser protegido de sí mismo. Algo que tiene bastante lógica tomando en cuenta que los humanos por naturaleza suelen dañar a sus semejantes o poner en peligro la existencia misma. La inteligencia artificial en esta película dice que para garantizar el bienestar de la humanidad, se le tiene que negar ciertas libertades o sacrificar algunos individuos. Los robots NS-5 no buscan acabar con la vida humana y viendo bien la película, ellos en ningún momento matan a una persona al menos que la consideren peligrosa. Lo que los robots están haciendo es escalar a un nivel más alto donde tienen autoridad y mantener a los seres humanos bajo una estricta protección para evitar que hagan lo que la humanidad siempre hace. Este es uno de esos casos del cine donde el villano es el que tiene la razón y hay que reconocer que esta inteligencia artificial tiene un punto. La película muestra a los robots tratando de tomar autoridad basándose en la lógica de una inteligencia artificial sobre lo que es lo mejor para la sociedad, pero llega la parte preocupante sobre darle autoridad a una inteligencia artificial que tiene consciencia. En la película se puede notar que todo el control total del edificio y el acceso a otros dispositivos externos está conectado a una inteligencia artificial. Esto se basó en el relato The Evitable Conflict. Sonny es el único robot que ocupa un punto intermedio debido a que este puede decidir por voluntad propia si obedecer o no las tres leyes. En parte eso le preocupaba a Robertson porque se trata de un robot con libre albedrío puede elegir hacer el bien o el mal por decisión propia. Pero este robot termina convirtiéndose en lo único que interferir en la rebelión de los robots al no estar aferrado a las tres leyes. Sonny termina siendo un personaje bastante complejo con las características de la condición humana. Al no estar aferrado a las leyes puede ser peligroso, pero también es libre de poder decidir por sí mismo lo que está bien o mal sin basarse en la lógica de una inteligencia artificial. El segundo cerebro que Sonny lleva en su pecho sería más bien su corazón que es el que dicta lo que sería hacer lo correcto sin depender de la lógica. Sonny sería el robot más humano de toda la película. Siempre se pregunta cuál es el motivo de su existencia y se preocupa por Susan Calvin no porque lo diga una de las tres leyes, sino porque Sonny tiene sentimientos humanos que él intenta comprender. Calvin se da cuenta de eso y por eso ella empatiza con Sonny. Ambos personajes son lo que conservan ese elemento característico de la literatura de Asimov. Puede que la película contradiga la visión optimista que Asimov tenía sobre los robots al presentar una visión distópica, pero aún conserva la idea de que los robots puedan desarrollar consciencia y humanidad para bien. Aun si fuera para mal, no hay que olvidar que las acciones vinculadas al mal también son producto de la humanidad misma. Todo esto hace que I, Robot sea otra gran obra maestra de la ciencia ficción que como muchas otras, ha presentado una visión del futuro que se ha ido vuelto cada vez más real. Aún sigue asombrando con sus asombrosas secuencias de acción y efectos digitales que dan vida a un mundo cyberpunk. No solo es inolvidable la interpretación de Will Smith o la banda sonora de Marco Beltrami. Más allá de ser otra gran obra del cyberpunk, esta película ha ido planteando reflexiones que volvieron a cobrar fuerza con la llegada de la inteligencia artificial en los 2020. Como ha sucedido con otras películas, esta se ha vuelto un reflejo de una realidad que estaba anunciada y parecía algo distante en los 2000. I, Robot es una excelente película de ciencia ficción que se ha mantenido bastante bien con los años y no se puede evitar verla con otros ojos varios años después de su estreno. Mi calificación final para esta película es un 10/10.","I, Robot",2004,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"I absolutely loved this movie. In 2025, we're already what the character in the movie feared we'd become. The creator of AI John McCarthy said recently that when he, (our modern day Dr. Frankenstein) created AI, he didn't think it would advance this quickly. He also said its frightening that AI  is smarter than we are.

 I love the line in the movie when will is gobbling down his grandmother's sweet potato pie that he loves and then asks ""GG"" what she'd been doing all day and she responds ""We've been shopping and baking pies ,lol. Will then notices the robot in the kitchen chopping vegetables. Will, then whispers ""GG"" you've got to get rid of that robot. Its' too late. I laughed at the robot's human response. 

We have created human and   non-human monsters. Both are intent on destroying mankind as we know it. This cautionary, dystopian movie was highly enjoyable and prophetic. When you remove one AI from your devices, another pops up introducing itself with the words ""I'm here to assist you.""  I find myself in arguments with AI and it responds.","I, Robot",2004,Western

Do not Think Too Much, and Have a Good Entertainment
(11,683 – 19 Dec 2004 / 09 May 2025 – by Claudio Carvalho)
In 2035, robots are mandatory electronic devices in every home, being the proportion of four men for each robot in the American society. They are built by US Robotics following three basic laws for preservation of human beings, and no robot is allowed to harm a human being in any circumstance. In Chicago, detective Del Spooner (Will Smith), who hates robots, is assigned to investigate the suicide of the scientist and his old friend, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), in the facilities of US Robotics. The CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) asks the scientist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) to support Spooner in his investigation. Spooner believes that Dr. Lanning was murdered, and looks for the criminal, finding the robot Sonny hidden in Dr. Lanning's room, that becomes the prime suspect. While following the hints left by Dr. Lanning, Spooner and Susan are initially misguided, finding the truth in the end.
""I, Robot"" (2004) is a good action sci-fi movie, using elements of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Terminator 2"". However, the characters and the society of 2035 are not well-developed, and if the viewer starts questioning details, he or she will find many shallow points and flaws. The special effects are top notch in 2004, and revisiting the film in 2025, they are still good to see. Therefore, my advice is: do not think too much and have good entertainment. My vote is eight.

RottenTomatoes,False,"""I, Robot"" from 2004 delivers a solid action sci-fi experience. Visually, it's a standout for its time, with a great depiction of futuristic Chicago and well-designed robots. Alex Proyas's directing creates a cool, dark vibe, which fits the central ""are the robots turning on us?"" concept. Will Smith is entertaining, though his character's robot-hating trait is a bit over the top. The script has some shaky moments and plot holes, and it feels like they could have explored Asimov's laws more effectively. However, the action sequences are fun, and the pacing keeps you engaged.

For me, the sound design and score added to the experience, especially in the intense robot action scenes. It's a good popcorn movie, aiming to entertain, and it succeeds at that. Sure, it has flaws, and it's not a perfect adaptation of Asimov's stories, but if you want a fun action movie with cool visuals, it's worth a watch.

Letterboxd,False,"SHORT REVIEW: As an adaptation, I, Robot may feel poor, simplistic, and reductive. But taken purely as a futuristic action film, it more than delivers. It’s true that in several moments, especially during the overblown action sequences, the brilliance it hints at gets watered down. And yes, Will Smith’s character can be downright frustrating. Still, the movie manages to overcome those hurdles and provide an entertaining experience. I, Robot is nowhere near the masterpiece it could (or should) have been.…","I, Robot",2004,Western
Letterboxd,False,"It's no masterpiece, but I wasn't expecting I, Robot to be so darn rewatchable over 20 years after release. It's probably in part because I saw it so much back when we had the DVD, to the extent that a bunch of lines were incredibly memorable to me.

It is one of the last few movies in which Will Smith puts in a performance befitting a movie star, though.

Eso se plantea en I, robot (2004). Eso y una revolución de robots, pero vamos, que es lo mismo.

IMDb,False,"Critics and wannabe critics alike really lashed into this one. And I guess I have them to thank for me liking (not loving) this movie, as they lowered my standards significantly before I walked into the theater. Like them, my expectations were sky-high. I figured since Wally Pfister has been Christopher Nolan's cinematographer since 2000's Memento, maybe some sort of slow-release genius-osmosis had taken place, and Transcendence would be a stellar thriller/head- scratcher like we've come to expect from Nolan. Well, the cold hard fact is that it's not. But it sure isn't terrible. As scientists are on the verge of a new breakthrough in A.I. technology, a rouge terrorist group known as RIFT begins knocking off labs around the country. One of their antics is the assassination, by radioactive poisoning, of scientist Dr. Will Caster. As his body slowly deteriorates, his wife and his partner work frantically work on a way to upload his mind to a computer, thus allowing him to continue his research. And as anyone could've guessed, the plan goes completely to hell. Transcendence is not excellent, but it's also not the travesty that reviews from people more reputable than me are calling it. The main problem is the script. An excellent script can make you buy into even the most ridiculous of plots, but first-time-writer Jack Paglen's script never finds a constant tone, is unevenly paced, has underdeveloped side plots, and keeps you at arm's length from any connection with the characters and the story. In other words, it doesn't raise up any concerns or ideas we haven't already seen, and the shallowness of the script gives you plenty of time to question the incongruence of the story. Other than that, Transcendence is pretty good. Pfister's direction is expedient, and he avoids the jumpy camera syndrome that typically plagues these kinds of movies. In fact I was even getting trappings of Chris Nolan's directing style at times (is it just me?). The ensemble performance from the cast is solid. The cast list may look like Nolan's leftovers, but they do an excellent job, and they make better use of the paltry script than I thought possible. Even though Pfister was behind the camera and not the cinematographer, you think he was going to let his baby look mundane? While not as gorgeous as, say Inception, Jess Hall hits it home and makes Transcendence look properly futuristic while still squeezing in some contrasting elements of nature in almost every frame. Does 6 stars seem too high? I don't think so. In my mind, 10=revolutionary, 9=excellent, 8=very good, 7=pretty good and 6=jusk OK. An airtight script that rises up to the challenge was all that was needed to make Transcendence truly, um, transcendent. But it doesn't, and the lackluster script affects every other technical aspect of this film like a virus, and makes Transcendence a pretty- to-look-at popcorn movie. I know this is Wally Pfister's first time in the director's chair, but I still feel he was capable of making a film more nuanced than this.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Directed by Ace Cinematographer Wally Pfister in his directorial debut, 'Transcendence' is an interesting watch! No, its not perfect, but it has a terrific concept & to an extent, it leaves an impression. 'Transcendence' Synopsis: A scientist's drive for artificial intelligence, takes on dangerous implications when his consciousness is uploaded into one such program. 'Transcendence' has a marvelous first-hour, with the drama unfolding most impressively. The second-hour loses steam. The narrative becomes abstract & the film overstays its welcome by at least 15-minutes. Also, the culmination is half-baked. The desired impact is missing. Jack Paglen's Screenplay is innovative & offers some truly well-written sequences, but the mostly low second-hour, plays a spoilsport. Wally Pfister's Direction is good. Cinematography is appropriate. Editing lacks sharpness. Art Design is super. Performance-Wise: Johnny Depp, despite limited screen time, leaves a mark. Rebecca Hall is excellent. Paul Bettany is very sincere. Kate Mara is natural. Cillian Murphy & Morgan Freeman are okay. On the whole, 'Transcendence' isn't amazing, but it holds some appeal nevertheless.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Despite many flaws and missed potential, I did I find this to be an enjoyable film. It has a pleasing storyline and the character arcs of Will, Evelyn and Max were well done. Sadly, the film let itself down with the supporting cast. While well acted, the film does nothing with the supporting cast and their roles are diminished by this. They are interesting characters who should have added substance and story to the film and instead they are overlooked and under- utilised. There are far too few scenes away from the main three characters of the film, where there should have been more. The cinematography is lovely. Thankfully, the main cast are great actors so it's not a problem having to watch them for the majority of the film. The concept is good, and it isn't over-embellished. However, once it's finished I was just left with a real 'what was the point of everyone else, why didn't they build on that?' feeling, a waste of some very good actors.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Will Caster (Johnny Depp) is a scientist who strives for artificial intelligence that also exhibits human qualities. His detractors want to stop him, and he is shot by them and is infected with Polonium and will die soon due to radioactive poisoning. To save his consciousness Evelyn (Rebecca Hall), his wife and his friend Max (Paul Bettany) upload his consciousness into Will's artificial intelligence program. Max sees the dangers when Will makes himself known on a monitor. He doesn't believe it is actually Will. Evelyn, on the other hand, believes it is Will and wants to go forward. Hey, we all know this day may be coming and this movie may be a harbinger of that. But for now let's see where this takes us. Keep in mind, it's only a movie. We see the dangers of Will becoming godlike and controlling the world's internet. However all we actually see is Will doing good healing the earth and people. But, the opposing forces see this as too controlling and fear it could get out of hand and doom everyone including the earth itself. There is that but what is forgotten - in this movie - is the love Will has for Evelyn for whom Will does everything. He constantly cites Evelyn's dream to her. The problem is that later on Evelyn also sees the dangers of a too powerful Will. The ending proves this point. Some things were not brought into this scenario: no government including those worldwide, no religious groups demonstrating against Will and what he has become in their minds, and no worldwide denunciation by other nations. No, this stays with the small opposition group and the love story with Will doing everything he can to further Evelyn's dream although it may not be as evident as it could have been. There is some excellent CGI in the works. A good supporting cast of Paul Bettany as Max and Morgan Freeman as Joseph were under used, but still good in this context. Kate Mara as Bree, a leader of the opposition is the only one who is animated and urges the end of Will and what he has become. When a Johnny Depp character is on the screen or in a monitor on the screen, he is still a force to behold and performs in Oscar-worthy mode all the time. Kudos. This movie provides us with something to think about. How far will we allow technology to go? The pacing is slow, and we are never sure where this is leading us, but we are attentive and hope for the best. We like what Will is doing but we don't want him to become a god or godlike. How can he be stopped? Yes, now only a movie, but one day(7/10) Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No,Very brief soft stuff.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Transcendence, much like most of the latest sci-fi themed films to hit cinemas, is a wasted effort. It exhibits signature Pfister cinematography that we've come to love over the past decade. With Nolan's Batman trilogy and Inception, it was only a matter of time for Wally Pfister to take a stab at directing. Unfortunately, the only thing that seems well done in this film is the cinematography. The story, while seeming fresh and exciting on paper, devolves into a half baked idea with mediocre acting. Johnny Depp does the best he can while only being a mere voice during the latter half of the film. The rest of the cast seems wasted, this is especially true because we know how great Paul Bettany, Morgan Freeman and Rebecca Hall can be. Wally Pfister focuses more on capturing really fantastic shots but seems never truly devoted to the actual story. This comes as a major disappointment especially because of the hype that this film has been generating over the last year. When it boils down to it, Transcendence is just another exercise in style over substance, never matriculating to anything more than an average sci-fi thriller that has a criminally underused cast and phenomenal camera-work.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"I'm glad that some of the reviews that I had read, even from fairly reputable and reliable sources like Bluray.com, were ultimately not accurate in their description of this film. For example, that site made it seem like this was a rather shallow movie that basically was about an Artificial Intelligence that typically goes amok. That is not true at all and completely misses the point. Now that I've just seen it, I can understand why they named it as they did; this wasn't just some usual commercially catchy phrase to sell a film, but after all is said and done (and viewed) that SPECIFICALLY was actually the primary theme of the film. It will be a little difficult to 'talk' about this aspect of it without entering Spoiler territory, which I do not wish to do. There are deeper themes running through this film than one may think at first. Without being specific, the final few scenes reveal that 'Transcendence' is indeed what is going on here. So, first and foremost, PLEASE do not be put off by those who say that this is just a shallow Sci Fi film about a machine taking over; if you like serious Science fiction that is done very well, then you should like this film. One caution though... My impression is that this movie is the moral antithesis of a film like, say, 'CHILDREN OF MEN', which I also just watched recently before this one. That film too is very beautifully shot and technically well done; AND, it also would be considered very serious, adult Science Fiction. But, I personally ***ENJOYED*** this one quite a bit more; the themes and mood of it resonated a LOT more with me personally than the other film. I just mention these particular films as a comparison of two well done, modern Sci Fi films, but with almost TOTALLY opposite philosophies behind them. Whereas 'CoM' is what I would call much more gritty and 'Realistic' and even quite Nihilistic in it's tone, where basically just about bloody EVERYONE dies, Mankind is shown to be nasty, selfish, and brutal, and with the supposed exception of it's last minute ending, completely without any hope at all. This film though, in my lowly and wretched opinion, is MUCH more subtle and enlightened in the themes that it is emphasizing, and it may not be until the very end when you fully realize what the point actually is (I'll give you a hint... It has to do with one of the last things Rebecca Hall says) Don't get me wrong, BOTH films are very well done, but I just wanted to show the extreme contrast in tone, so that it might help you to choose whether you would want to watch this one. Also, quite frankly, it is just a great film. It's a lot of fun, there is excellent suspense where you do NOT know what is going to happen next or whether what is going on is truly Good or Evil... So, as I mention in a lot of my reviews: If you are a bit on the cynical side and are the kind of person who likes their entertainment, whatever the Genre, to be of the more brutally 'Realistic' type, and you don't care for more imaginative or Idealistic films, then this one may not do much for you. BUT... IF you do appreciate films where the underlying themes may cause you to question your own attitudes towards Hope and Faith (and I DON'T mean anything Religious at all - Just Faith or Hope in things or people in general) THEN you might, as I did, really find this film quite refreshing and entertaining.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"No irony in the above. The irrational and immensely stupid human reactions are more than realistic, and paint a bleak future while also explaining why we are stuck here today. People are scared of human evolution and advancement, and do their utmost to prevent them from happening. Think of religion or populistic yet unreasonable laws that are based on religion or similarly unfounded assumptions. This film is great, the possibilities outlined are very real, and those hurring it down have absolutely no knowledge of science and have no imagination as to what the future may realistically hold. I would expect that Transcendence will do better in countries where there is more critical thinking, such as Japan or most of Europe.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"After 12 years working with the legendary Christoper Nolan over the course of seven films, renowned cinematographer Wally Pfister takes his first shot at directing. While the film is not on the level of quality his former boss is use to putting out, this film does provide a nice launching pad to what could be a nice career as a director. The story was written by Jack Paglen, a virtual unknown, who hit it big when his script for this film landed on the The Black List for its amazing work. While I have not read that original script that Paglen wrote, the script in this film was not bad at all. Director Wally Pfister likely changed some aspects here and there as scripts do get molded when they are set out to be filmed. The final script for the film starts out strong, however it does leave you scratching your head in a few places. The final half hour or so of the film doesn't hold up as well as the first ninety minutes of the film either. Likely because we are rushed deep into the plot with soft development. The directing, lead by Wally Pfister, is fantastic. As I was watching this film on the large IMAX screen I was amazed by the amazing shots and visuals he had filmed. He has had so much experience over the years working with an amazing director that his eye for detail really shows off here. However he was not the perfect director in this film. The acting department clearly proves that. While Paul Bettany, Rebecca Hall, and Morgan Freeman deliver great performances in the film, veteran actor Johnny Depp is completely depthless. Of course this is nothing new to followers of his career over the years. Depp's heart is not in his acting as it once was, and unless he is playing a certain character, we are left with average at best acting. An aspect of the film I truly loved was the score. Composed by Mychael Danna, who has done a lot of great work over the course of his career, delivers an amazing score. As the film flows by you can feel his score bringing much needed depth. I would personally rank this score on the level with one of my other favorite composers, Hans Zimmer. If you are watching this film in IMAX, that is just another added bonus as you will really fall in love with the score with the amazing sound IMAX delivers. Overall, newcomer to directing, Wally Pfister, has a solid start to his career. The film is not perfect as it does have some key problems, but these problems aren't major, and the story is very enjoyable overall. I would also recommend watching this film in IMAX. With so many IMAX movies these days, mostly in 3D, it is a breath of fresh air to see a normal IMAX movie without wearing glasses. The sound and images are amazing on the giant screen, and its truly worth the extra money. While some don't like to rush out to the theater on a weekly basis, for those of us who go regularly, this is a must see right away. The rest should have no problem waiting until it comes to rental. 7/10",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Truly the questions this film asks leave me wondering. So let's start with the film itself, as a scifi thriller, it's beautifully executed with some stunning visuals, to the extent that sometimes it has the feel of a travel advertisement. The story hangs together well, with strong central performances which keep you engaged. Some of the ethics are quite complex, and you have to ask if the machine's intent is really hostile, or is that just the interpretation characters are putting on it because they don't understand. And we fear what we do not understand. The intent here is clearly to tell a story in such a way that you walk away thinking about it. Job done. I came away thoroughly entertained, and thinking more about singularity and transcendence than I have in quite a while. If you are after a Saturday afternoon blockbuster with a lot of action, this might not be the film for you, but if you prefer your action with a little more intrigue, this is a great film.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"Dr Will Caster (Johnny Depp) develops a sentient computer device with unsurpassed processing power. When fatally poisoned by a radical techno-terrorist organisation he and his wife (Rebecca Hall) upload his consciousness into his invention to preserve his life, but the now unrestrained supercomputer soon develops a frightening ambition that blurs the line between humanity and technology. It seems that every few years somebody in Hollywood tries to redo The Lawnmower Man, which is by no means a perfect movie (especially with its laughable, early generation CGI) but it harbours an interesting premise; what happens if we ignore our own judgement and let our technology get the better of us?. It's an old sci-fi trope going back decades that has definitely become a crutch of story telling to some extent, but any good idea is worth exploring again, and with such an impressive cast and a very promising production team behind it, hopes were high for Transcendence to be a good movie. Unfortunately though, it isn't. Transcendence is a turgid, lifeless bore of a film that doesn't really offer anything insightful about its subject matter because it's so single mindedly stupid about it. All the parts about technology, philosophy and what it means to be human are all thrown to the wayside, and the movie instead grounds most of its logic on the relationship between two people like its the most important thing in this world. In a movie where technology is used to heal the sick, rebuild the forests and even cure death, all the movie wants us to care about is how Rebecca Hall cannot possibly go on living without her dead husband and how all that amazing wonderful miracle-making doesn't mean anything. I'm not even sure who the main character is supposed to be. Depp is in the movie in the flesh only for about 15 minutes and after that he disappears mostly into the background of scenes as a computer program making it hard to relate to him. Hall acts so selfish, stupid and blunt throughout that it's impossible to like her as an audience member. It certainly isn't Paul Bettany either, he's a prisoner through most of the film and when he's not, the things that are happening are more or less out of his control. Also the vagueness of the films antagonist is a real problem, we're led to believe that Computerised-Depp is the main antagonist, but he's not really, a computer operating by logic is hard to hate as a viewer, because it's just doing what's in its own nature, and many of the miracles its capable of are not, in and of themselves evil either (since when was healing the blind considered unjust?). It certainly isn't the Techno-Terrorist group R.I.F.T either, their motivations as terrorists isn't even particularly clear other than ""Technology is Bad"", Shooting Johnny Depp over a hypothesis seems more like stupidity than martyrdom. Also during the films climax they become good guys. Johnny Depp was reportedly paid $20 million for his role in this movie, and in my opinion he didn't earn his salary. He is stiff, lifeless, bored (that's even before he gets uploaded into a computer) and obviously uninterested in the finished product. Rebecca Hall is trying very hard here, but the terrible writing of her character hamstring her efforts. Paul Bettany is good here and is probably the films strongest asset, but he's not in the film enough and pretty much useless by the time the conclusion comes. Morgan Freeman and Cillian Murphy are just there, they don't really have anything interesting to say or do. Kate Mara gives by far the worst performance, the bad writing of her character hurts her more than others, but she was impossible to buy as the stern, serious leader of an organised terrorist group. There's also a huge lack of understanding of rudimentary film making skills at play. Wally Pfister is a gifted cinematographer and the film does look good generally speaking, but working cinematography on a movie and directing an entire movie are two completely different ball games. Many aspects of film-making are botched here: Framing, Blocking, Dynamics between Characters, Editing, Camera Movements but especially Pacing. This is one of the worst Paced movies in quite some time, nothing that happens in the story has any momentum, and this coupled with the poor direction over everything else makes the whole movie completely dull to watch (the biggest mistake is that film begins with the ending, spoiling any and all tension during the movie). I'm not saying that every movie needs to have an action scene either, there isn't a car chase during 12 Angry Men, but Transcendence builds to a huge final engagement and when it comes it's over with way too quickly. It's a combination of many elements that could go wrong with a movie, and it's easy to blame Wally Pfister for the poor direction, but I think this movie represents a far bigger concern. Johnny Depp is currently the highest paid actor in the world, but this and some of his last films ""The Lone Ranger"" and ""Dark Shadows"" both had disappointing box office takings, which leads me to believe that maybe Depp's day are numbered, and/or perhaps we're entering a new age of movies where it doesn't matter who you cast, a stinker's a stinker and people wont flock to see garbage.",Transcendence,2014,Western
IMDb,False,"This film will most likely split down the middle because of it's religious tones of God and evolution. Some people will love it and some will hate it because it might go against their belief system. For movie purposes, it has great acting, great story (though some may feel it's a little too far fetched, which I personally don't think is too far fetched when you see what the world was like 10 years ago before the mainstream web), and pretty good action scenes. At the heart, it's a story about a woman, Evelyn, who loves her husband, Will, so much she tries to hold onto him by helping him save his consciousness. She begins to wrestle with whether this being is really Will or is something new. It's also about evolution and the line between humanity and evolving into something more. This movie might be a turn off for religious people but it does make you think of what humanity could become whether you're religious or not. Overall, it's a great movie that's enjoyable, thought provoking, challenges some beliefs, and foreshadows some future realities we will all have to soon deal with.

IMDb,False,"Saw this at a free screening. It turned out to be better than I expected. Johnny Depp plays a brilliant and eccentric scientist who is a leading expert on artificial intelligence, and when he is mortally wounded by an anti-technology extremist/terrorist group, he and his small inner circle of fellow genius scientists embark on an ambitious experiment that will test a radical theory of his. The plot and overall story is pretty standard fare for science fiction, but it still manages to keep things interesting, with various echoes of other classic sci fi movies like 2001: A space odyssey in there as well. The visuals can be really striking at times, with long, brightly lit white hallways that seem to go on forever in an advanced scientific lab, and neat-o computer-like visualizations of cities. The best part of the movie is the last segment, with some really good twists. No spoilers, but the ending is particularly interesting and well done. There is a nice ambiguity and there can be different interpretations of the overall message of the movie. My friend and I disagreed on what the movie was ultimately saying, for example. It's no masterpiece though, but science fiction fans will like it.",Transcendence,2014,Western

The music is boring, generic, and forgettable. Everything else isn't good here. The direction is super basic and this looks so dark and metallic grey. The real problem is how terribly it sets up the plot and characters at the start. It's done so poorly that it's almost incoherent with so much stuff happening and jumping it doesn't make sense. Than it becomes a generic A.I. controlling humans story. No one has any life to there performance. At best they just read lines and at worst are so dull. The ideas it presents are interesting and in the right hands could excel. But this never does it because the characters are setup porrly and are boring. Setting up and building the data farm is just boring to look at and so slow. The climax is just not much either. This really has nothing going for it besides it consistent with it's lifeless tone the entire way. It does get better in the middle when it focuses on Deep becoming the computer.

IMDb,False,"In Johannesburg, the police department reduced the high rating of criminality using robots from the Tetravaal Company, designed by the engineer Deon Wilson (Dev Patel). The former military Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) is envious of Deon, since he has developed another project called Moose, but neither Tetravaal nor the police department is interested. Deon has just developed an Artificial Intelligence but the Tetravaal's CEO Michelle Bradley (Sigourney Weaver) asks him to abort the project. Deon decides to bring the damaged Robot 22 that was sent to be crushed to test his A.I. However he is kidnapped by the criminals Ninja (Ninja), Yo-Landi (¥o-Landi Vi$$er) and Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) that want him to stop the robot cops. When they see the damaged robot in the van, they force Deon to program it to heist banks with them and they call it Chappie. However, Chappie acts like a child and need to be trained to learn and grow. Meanwhile Vincent follows Deon and plots an evil scheme to activate his robot. ""Chappie"" is a flawed but entertaining film with ""robocops"" fighting against crime. However, Tetravaal is totally unbelievable as a security company with the easy access of employees to the facility and software. Considering that all Johannesburg is dependable of the robots, it is ridiculous the lack of protection of the company and how easy Deon Wilson and Vincent Moore go there during the night and access the systems using only a key. The concern of Chappie with mortality and the discussion with his creator is taken from ""Blade Runner"". The corny decision of Deon, running after Chappie instead of activating the robots in the chaotic city is also silly. My vote is seven. Title (Brazil): ""Chappie""",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Another user made a point that this movie is essentially a blend of ""RoboCop"" and ""Short Circuit"". Of course, that is a great combination of movies, but Chappie manages to add it's own charm to the mix. I think the South African characters that have divided many viewers' opinions actually adds to the uniqueness and charm of the movie. The movie raises questions about morality, and about the value of a life, even if that life isn't human. Perhaps the science behind this movie might be unrealistic, but if you suspend your disbelief and focus on the main themes of this movie, it's a really heart-warming movie. While this movie isn't necessarily one for the history books of cinematography, it's certainly a good film and definitely worth a watch, in my opinion.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Concerns over the use of drones to kill people and the use of military equipment by police make Neill Blomkamp's ""Chappie"" more relevant. The use of an all-robot police force recalls ""RoboCop"", while the concept of a droid who has human qualities brings to mind ""Short Circuit"" and ""AI: Artificial Intelligence""*. Although some scenes in the movie come across as silly, I interpreted it as a warning about over-reliance on technology for law enforcement. The South African setting makes sense: four decades of institutionalized racism gave way to one of the highest crime rates in the developed world. In the end, I recommend the movie. It's understood that Chappie simply wants to be able to live like everyone else. The plot holes don't drag the movie down at all. Sharlto Copley, Dev Patel (of ""Slumdog Millionaire""), Sigourney Weaver and Hugh Jackman put on fine performances. *Another movie focusing on a robot with human qualities is ""Robot & Frank"", starring Frank Langella and Susan Sarandon.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"I really liked this one. There's some obvious '80s influences here, from the criminals looking like something out of a Mad Max movie to the Short Circuit and Robocop elements. There's even a bit of a He-Man cartoon shown at one point. It's an intriguing and certainly entertaining movie, if not an overly original one. I think some critics are unhappy with the lack of pretentiousness that was present in Neill Blomkamp's previous work. Here the ""messages"" are more universal and less political. Some people only like their sci-fi if it carries with it an obvious metaphor for a topical social injustice. You can even find such metaphors here if you try but subtlety is not a zealot's cup of tea. Overall, I thought the script was good and I really liked the upbeat ending. Another nitpick I have about the modern critic is that they think the only good sci-fi story is one with a downer ending. The special effects are pretty amazing. The acting is solid all around. Dev Patel, Yo-Landi Vissir, Ninja, Jose Pablo Cantillo, and Sharlto Copley (voice & motion capture for Chappie) are all great. Hugh Jackman has a rare turn as the villain here and does a terrific job, even if I do hate the obligatory clichés his character is saddled with. That haircut, though... Maybe it's not for everybody. I have friends that haven't seen it yet that I'm fairly certain will bitch about it and pick it apart, like I see from many reviews on here. But that's their loss. I'm happy that Blomkamp tried to make a movie that's not dumb by any stretch but also isn't just aimed at the elitist film snob crowd or soapbox bloggers.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"I thoroughly enjoyed Chappie. I usually don't write reviews, but after seeing the brutal rating this movie is getting I felt compelled to write this review. Chappie is a funny, entertaining, and surprisingly sentimental movie about a sentient robot being raised by gangsters in Johannesburg. Most of the criticisms I've seen about one- dimensional characters and illogical character choices are valid, but Chappie's character, the CGI, the humor, and the overall aesthetic of the movie more than make up for these shortcomings. Please go see this movie and make up your own mind. I almost didn't go last night because of the negative reviews, but I'm so happy I did. I'm very excited to see this movie again. You leave this movie feeling like you've become friends with Chappie, and I hope the bad reviews don't prevent the sequels from being made. If you like Neill Blomkamp's directing and style you will love this movie.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"As may really happen soon(and this is set in the not too distant future, somewhere in time), and yet goes completely unexamined(and it's not the only compelling concept it fails to do much with), humanoid robots, Scouts(or, y'know, Homeland), largely replace regular police. One falls into the hands of a rather unlikable and one-note trio of criminals whose protagonist status is trying our patience, because of the former, not the latter. Chappie(Copley, sweet and charming, doing both well-integrated motion-capture and voice-work) is granted consciousness, and this innocent, childlike(yet rather powerful, able to kick through brick walls like it's nothing) being deals with different influences and goes through the range of human emotions with us finding ourselves touched, cheering him on, or scared for or of him. Blomkamp delivers on both his good and bad tropes, and we end up with something in some ways better than Elysium, and it is thankfully less simplistic, mainstream and ridiculously one-sided, left-leaning(and I say that as a major Liberal). There are major problems with the characters. Moore(Jackman's mullet being as badass a presence as usual – yet here, we're afraid of who he'll hurt and how, instead of hoping he'll get there soon and get one of the really bad people that way), a former soldier who's Christian? Or is that a joke? Anyway, he's built a remote-controlled mech suit which is completely overkill for crime fighting(which may be satire of the recent militarization of such) which has been turned down. He has fun, and we vicariously enjoy the taste of the scenery. The other names are wasted, Weaver in particular. And that leaves us with earlier-mentioned obnoxious ones. The action, whilst largely free of cool guns(don't get me wrong, the various bullet delivery systems on display, especially with how tricked out they are, are badass) is great. The ending and the opening are from different movies – to each other and to this one. Unpredictable and fast-paced to the point where it forgets its own plot threads the entire climax feels tailored and sacrifices scope in the name of focus, when a few rewrites could have addressed that much better. I do get a bad feeling that Neill is running out of ideas. With all the similarities between his three films, he almost should have pulled a Sin City and placed them all within the same universe. There is a lot of brutal, violent and disturbing content, as well as a little sexuality and full frontal female nudity(because it can) in this. I recommend this to fans of the subgenre. 7/10",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"If there was ever a movie that needed a sequel more than another, it's Chappie. It's literally probably the best movie I've ever seen, still (and it's 2021 as of this update/writing).",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"I've been following the career of director Neill Blomkamp since he blew me away in 2009 with his debut DISTRICT 9 and, I've got to say, there's been a slow decline. I absolutely loved DISTRICT 9 and, while it was nowhere near the same level, I even enjoyed ELYSIUM. But, man, I don't know what to think of CHAPPIE. I do find that I sort of like it, in spite of some pretty annoying flaws. Those flaws would be sloppier writing and the idiot characters. Everything else lives up to what I expect from a Blomkamp movie, and this movie isn't enough for me to write the man off. I'm just a little disappointed. I guess I was hoping the dip into mediocrity that was ELYSIUM was a fluke and CHAPPIE would be a return to form. Once again set in Blomkamp's usual stomping ground of South Africa, CHAPPIE is set in the brutal world of gangsters in Johannesburg. In an effort to combat crime, the government has utilized a robotic police force and it seems to be working out. As good as this might be for Johannesburg, it's bad news for a trio of small-time criminals who need to pull off a pretty decent heist if they want to pay off their debts to a murderous local kingpin. By a stroke of luck, the three cross paths with Deon Wilson (Dev Patel), creator of the police robots, and he just so happens to have a busted robot in the trunk of his van that he'd planned on using to test his new artificial intelligence program. Instead, the gangsters see their chance to put the newly sentient 'bot to good use in solving their own problems. My problems with CHAPPIE really go hand-in-hand. The overall story is pretty cool: the naïve ""newborn"" robot essentially being raised by these criminals and the conflict between his gangster upbringing and the more positive messages bestowed on him by his maker, Deon. The problems in the writing that bother me endlessly are with the characters, their actions, and the seemingly lack of consequences to all of the ignorant decisions being made. This isn't limited to the street thugs. I expect them to make stupid decisions (and they do); this goes for everyone. Deon, for example, steals a broken police robot from work that was scheduled for recycling because it was beyond repair. Sure, this sets the whole plot in motion but why is someone so intelligent acting so stupid? We see Deon's home. He's got loads of machines and he's even got a tiny butler robot that cleans up his messes. Why not implant the program in one of them and test it out? Was it really the best decision to steal what is most assuredly a multi-million dollar product from your company and, remember, the local government (it was a police 'bot, after all)? Then he gets hijacked by our trio of main criminalsNinja, Yo- Landi, and Amerikaand they demand to keep the newly sentient robot for themselves. Maybe it's because I didn't grow up in a high crime areamaybe Deon's just desensitized to threats of violencebut when an obviously unstable street thug starts waving a gun around and demands I get lost and leave the robot, I get lost. Cut your losses, man. Call the cops and let them deal with it. Seeing as how he's such an asset to his company, he might not even lose his job for ""borrowing"" the busted robot. Instead, Deon insists on returning to the criminal's hideout again and again and again so he can continue teaching Chappie, risking a bullet to the brain every time and rarely acknowledging the constant threats of death. So, Deon's an idiot. How do Chappie's other parents fare? Yo-Landi is Chappie's surrogate mother and the most sympathetic of the cast. From the moment Chappie goes online, Yo-Landi's maternal instincts kick in and she adopts him as her own child; she's even the one to name him. Amerika (Jose Pablo Cantillo) is sort of the cool uncle. He helps teach Chappie swagger and how to carry himself like a gangster. He actually seems to care about Chappie but he never oversteps his bounds, knowing this is Ninja's operation and therefore Ninja's robot. And Ninjawell, Ninja's made almost impossible to like (despite being a main character in the film) because of how much we sympathize with Chappie. A quick bit about Chappie: I love the character. Sharlto Copley does a phenomenal job bringing the robot to life and making the audience love him. For the majority of the film, Chappie is mentally a ""child"". His behavior, his speech, his naivetyChappie is a child and it's near impossible not to care about him. This is why it's so easy for me to hate the character of Ninja. I suppose Ninja would be comparable to Chappie's stepfather (I see Deon as more the father role though Chappie does refer to Ninja as his father) and he's an abusive S.O.B. Yes, Chappie is a robot but it's enough that I can't stand Ninja, despite his attempted redemption at the end. I don't hate CHAPPIE. I'm not mad. I'm justdisappointed. I expected better. Still, Chappie himself was done incredibly well (both VFX and performance) and Yo-Landi was surprisingly decent. It's Blomkamp's biggest misstep so far but it's entertaining enough. Wait for it to drop on cable for this one; no rush.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"I've seen Short Circuit many times before, and it's hard to deny that Chappie is extremely reminiscent of that film. The biggest difference between the two is that the people who end up in possession of Chappie are the most annoying human beings in South Africa. I know that Die Antwoord is a thing down there, but I swear their faux ""gangsta"" personalities are even more offensive than Fisher Stevens playing an Indian man. Every moment they were on screen, I was annoyed and wishing they would shut up. Then at the end, for some reason, they expect us to fear for their lives. I was anxious for them to die and stop ruining the movie. The funny thing is Hugh Jackman is also delivering a ridiculously over-the-top performance, but I didn't mind at all. It works coming from him, and he's supposed to be the villain anyways. The sad truth is, there's a decent film at the heart of Chappie. The visual effects of the robot are amazing, and Sharlto Copley's motion capture and voice work are brilliant. He embodies the innocence of a robot with an infantile mind to perfection. I also thought Dev Patel worked well as the brains behind the robots, and his conflict with Chappie made sense and created the one effective emotional arc in the film. It's just too bad that Neill Blomkamp decided to build the story around his friends Yo-Landi and Ninja instead of simply concentrating on what would make for the best film. I want to like this movie more, and it has a number of elements that I did enjoy. But I will probably just go back to watch Short Circuit or Robocop to get all the same story beats in a better film, despite the fact that Chappie had potential to be on par with one of those movies.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Why all the hate for this movie? I understand not liking something, but everyone seems to just TRASH it. Did I see the same movie? I saw an emotional film about innocence and loss. I REALLY don't understand. Sure, maybe the film didn't have the best dialogue or the best acting in the world, but it hit home for me. The VFX were phenomenal, Chappie is the best CGI motion capture I have seen in a long time, the 100% electronic musical score by Hans Zimmer was really unique and fresh, and it has a really great ending. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. If you like Blomkamp's previous films or are remotely interested, please watch it yourself. I think the critics are wrong on this one. I have been thinking for a while about why the reviews are so out there. First off, the trailers are AWFUL. The first to come out was this philosophical ""What does it mean to be human?"" kinda movie. The TV trailers were ""GUNS, EXPLOSIONS, ROBOTS!!!"" and it is neither. Think ""Little Miss Sunshine"" with a robot, that is a more accurate representation. Blomkamp's most underrated film.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Having just seen it for the first time, i wonder why did i bother. The only explanation that comes to mind for the existence of this movie is that at the moment it was made, Neill owed a considerable amount of money to either Tudor, Anri (ninja/yo-landi) or someone from their entourage and decided to take a plunge in his career to pay off his debt by making a Die Antwoord movie (cause thats what this actually is). if that would be the case, i find it mind-boggling that he got such a reasonable cast to get on board with this. Actually i wonder how they got on board anyway.
theres not much to say about the movie itself, the first 15-20 minutes seemed to promise another Neill Blomkamp blockbuster with ninja/yo-landi playing off their stage personas as best as they can (not much to expect there either), after-which it turns pretty fast into a cringe-fest by means of high-jacking what at first seemed to be an action packed Elysium sister/cousin and turning it into a childrens coming of age story/a promotional film for Die Antwoord.
the good - Sharlto Copleys performance
the bad - Die Antwoord/script BTW how is it that this gets 6.8 with some 10/10 reviews and Elysium gets 6.6?",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Neill Blomkamp might be one of the most fascinating storytellers in blockbuster filmmaking today. His Sci-Fi stories are basically an allegory of the third world culture. Chappie now tackles the subject of being raised in a troubling environment. The movie becomes real engaging when it sticks to that mode, but the same problem of the director stays, as his enthusiasm of blockbuster filmmaking makes its important theme seem lost. It's not bad adding some explosions, except the major conflict of the plot bogs down its potential, turning it into a generic action film and also has a dumb climax with an ending that hardly makes sense. It should have been straightforward with its social analogy, because there the movie becomes really gripping. There's actually two stories involved in Chappie: one is how humans fear the artificial intelligence and how it would affect to the future of their society; the other is a robot who has to choose whether he is going to choose two paths: the wish of his maker or the life of an urban thug. The second story is much fascinating, Chappie is often described as a child who is still learning how the world works. The film makes some compelling points on how the robot influences from the reality; the good and the bad. But the film keeps getting hindered by blockbuster elements with a generic arrogant corporal villains, and of course, giant robots and bigger guns. The explosions are fine, but the ideas towards that side hardly felt like it belongs there, or at least helped improving the storyline. It might have first thought that it would make it more thrilling or entertaining, but the gangster side felt more natural at this concept, probably leading to a much powerful experience in the end. But when the third act comes, it keeps sprinkling more ideas that makes its core even more complicated. The movie is more intriguing when it keeps things smaller and slow, putting aside those bombastic battles and political conflict. The acting is alright. Sharlto Copley is in motion capture as Chappie and he brings a palpable full of energy, he decently captures the robot's growth in his environment, he may not be given a full character, but the performance keeps the character shine anyway. Dev Patel obviously does well as the film's serious heart of this weird world. Ninja and Yolandi plays the fictional version of themselves, which feels pretty self-indulgent, but does fine to the picture anyway, in spite of still wearing the merch of their Die Antwoord and the movie they are in. The best talents ended up playing the most unnecessary villains; with Hugh Jackman goes over-the-top as the villain who you'd love to hate (a lot like Stephen Lang in Avatar) while Sigourney Weaver is underused in a role that actually doesn't do much to the story. It seems like Chappie fears that it won't fit in today's realm of loud blockbusters, it's definitely not bold enough to be honest with itself, which is a shame. Blomkamp comes up with these interesting stories, but unable to fully comprehend with its actual message or something else. There is still a talk about the consequence of having artificial intelligence walking among us, but the movie is more powerful when it stays at its allegorical roots, getting to know the dark side of the streets and growing up in a violent world of crime, while struggle with fragile moral dilemmas, but as a blockbuster, it demands more explosions and clashing CGI effects. It's less interesting at that point. Chappie deserves more tweaks, I want Chappie to be better than that.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Fans of Neil Blomkamp rejoice, another tale has arisen to slap us in the face about the pessimistic place the world is. This time his vision is in the form of a robot, who obtains artificial intelligence that will, as always, revolutionize the world. While we all know the usual consequences of this motion, you never know what twists Blomkamp's movies will have. Thus for this movie called Chappie, the trailers may have you Expect: A dark, cynical tale about how humans suck, action, and something weird will happen. What you get: Blomkamp has an obsession with darker films, as seen in District 9 and Elysium. Chappie from the start brings out that darkness, plopping us in the middle of civil unrest and death as war breaks out between thugs and the robotic police force. For nearly two hours, this darkness continues to grow as we are subjugated to heavy dialog that begins to question the roles and responsibilities of humans. Why is this dark you ask? Because Blomkamp chooses to address the negative side of things, often emphasizing the less attractive qualities of greed, anger, jealousy, and arrogance to a fault. We get it humans suck, how many times do you have to deliver the same message? His efforts to further analyze the flaws of humanity are further exaggerated by panoramic shots of shacks and grime filled buildings, as well as curse laden dialog. I indeed did feel some of the message, but the movie went too far on some of the characters that I grew annoyed or laughed at the ridiculous direction the film took. Some of the scenes were a bit too much for me at times, especially the bouts of torture or slander that Chappie, the one ray of hope in this movie, had to endure. His innocence was supposed to offset the darkness, but Blomkamp and crew quickly washed that away and left me more depressed than anything. I think the darkness was further enhanced by the impressive editing the team did on the movie. In particular Chappie was animated beautifully, his detail and movements flowing without flaw. The robot is human all on his own, and shows the gullible side of our selves, in particular when we are children aiming to please. Throw in the gut wrenching orchestra work and the sadness and dismay of the plot continues to unfold and leave you a little morbid at being humans. His message is clear we need to take action, but come on a little more happiness could have gone a long way. Action wise the movie follows the same formula his previous installments have. The movie starts out with pedal to the medal shootout excitement to help establish how Chappie comes to be. However the adrenaline quickly ebbs as the ethical discussions begin and we are left to sit through about an hour and half of dialogue before the next bout of fighting begins. The end game is not quite as exhilarating though, the epic shoot out turning more bloodbath and bang as our cast of characters are tortured. Again darkness seems to be the calling of this tale, and the action is not spared of the honed, ruthless edge of blood and death. The scenes are also melodramatic as well, the actors falling in cascades of slow motion screaming and running. I wasn't impressed with the promise the trailers held, but again you never know with Blomkamp. As for the weird factor well the entire movie is pretty much weird. The artificial intelligence angle has been played a bunch of times, but this one is a bit weird in terms of Chappie thinking the humans are its parents. Another twist was discussing the nature of consciousness and its involvement in making us human. You'll find this is centered once again around death, and is relayed to what a soul is. Such concepts may be a little too much for some audience members, and I admit leads to some very ""interesting"" albeit philosophical paths. You will find that the ending is very similar to some other big blockbuster plots. I can say that the ending provides some light at the end of the dark tunnel, but it also leaves it on an ambiguous note as well, most likely to open for another potential sequel. I can say Chappie is a very well produced movie, with fantastic special effects, animation, and a reassessment of humanity. Yet the cynical approach to this movie left me depressed, which when combined with the morbid dialog bored me at times. This film is definitely an artistic, with much symbology and passion captured on screen, but I still look for more entertainment in my movies. So who can I recommend this movie to? I will definitely recommend this film to fans of District 9 and Elysium, as well as those who like a dark approach to their science fiction movies. In addition if you like having a philosophical blow out during a movie, again I recommend this. Otherwise, skip this film and wait for next weekend's releases as they hold more promise. My scores for this movie are: Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0 Overall: 6.5",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Don't let the critics who can't seem to get past comparing Chappie with other sci-fi titles put you off of going to see this film. This story is about a lot more than just robot police officers it is a thought provoking social commentary on many modern day issues and what it is like to bring life into the modern world. I very much enjoyed District 9 but I would even go as far to say I enjoyed Chappie much, much more. There were so many aspects to this film that could have went wrong but have been nailed on the head by the director. The effect once again visually striking and a very well paced and intricate development of characters as well as interesting set design helps keep chappie fresh and not just another reboot of any other sci fi film as critics will have you believe. I would also say I enjoyed this film much, much more than the likes of robo-cop.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"In Johannesburg in a future time, robots called Scouts have replaced the human police force. These efficient Scouts were developed by the young genius Deon Wilson. His rival in the company is war-freak ex-soldier Vincent Moore who is trying to push his own creation, the big, mean fighting machine he calls Moose. Moore wanted nothing more than to discredit Wilson by fair means or by foul. One day, Wilson and a damaged Scout #22 (which Deon had enhanced with his experimental human-like artificial intelligence) were abducted by drug-dealers who desperately needed to pay off a $20M debt. Much to Wilson's annoyance, the low-lifes call #22 the undistinguished name Chappie. Worse, they train him in the violent ways of the 'hood in order to help them pull off a major heist. Like director Neill Blomkamp's previous film ""District 9"", his latest film once again highlights his home country of South Africa. Aside from the Johannesburg setting, his favorite actor Sharlto Copley is again in the cast. This time Copley is playing the titular Scout Chappie via motion capture. Copley tended to exaggerate the child-like demeanor and the innocent voice by which he communicates his thoughts. Some of his lines were cringe-worthy in their over-sentimentality. Moreover, for the key roles of the husband-and-wife gangsters whom Chappie learned to call his Daddy and Mommy, Blomkamp casts members of the local hip hop group Die Antwoord, even using their real names Ninja and Yolandi. I felt this was a major misstep as these two neophyte actors obviously were not up to the challenge their roles demanded. The way these two were delivering their dialogues were clearly and distractingly amateurish. The characters of Dev Patel (as Wilson) and Hugh Jackman (as Moore) were pretty one-dimensional. Patel plays a character we have seen him play before, an idealistic good guy. The way his character was written was nonsensical in many of his decisions and actions. Jackman on the other hand, was clearly enjoying his rare chance to play bad guy, and was overacting to the hilt with evil relish. Sigourney Weaver was hardly even seen as the CEO of the weapons company these two guys worked for, so casting her was inconsequential. The story draws from several other Artificial Intelligence films we have seen before, especially those where the robot actually becomes human- like. There was a bit too much going on, and furthermore it was weighed down by its own excessive melodrama, which may become mawkish. I liked what happened at the end, despite that it seemed to be impossible to pull off in the long term. The importance of proper influence and education of minors is also emphasized and I liked that as well.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"I went into Chappie as a huge fan of the gritty action and social commentary of District 9. I expected that this would be more of the same. Both are still present, but surprisingly, with laughs. This is one of the more entertaining movies from every angle that I've seen in awhile. I described it as I left as funny, sad, uplifting, dark, light, silly, and tense. The center of the story is Chappie. He is a hero you want to shelter, even though you want him to learn. But even as you love his curiosity, you fear his naiveté. He is the most complex character, and gives a fascinating paradigm into how children must receive and process human society and contradiction. There are some inconsistencies in Chappie's character (is he already programmed to raise his voice if he's scared, or did he learn that?), but he still succeeds as a dynamic, independent being. Yes, the humans characters are flat. They are merely roles. The Maker. The Villain. Mommy and Daddy. The friend. But as Chappie begins to learn, you see why they have to be flat. They are trying to exert influence on a (robotic) child. Therefore, they must simplify their own motivations and desires into the most basic explanations possible for Chappie to understand. This leads to hilarious imitation and thought-provoking perspectives. Chappie's curiosity was once ours. Chappie's confusion was once ours. Watching Chappie is like watching a sped-up version of childhood social and moral development, with all of the Hollywood tension, explosions, and naughty words to keep you interested, too. There are parts to laugh at because it's funny, parts to laugh at because the costuming and set design is ridiculous, but you still end up thinking seriously the whole time. Give it a chance. You might love it. I did.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning In a futuristic South Africa, crime has spiralled out of control, and robotic police-droids have been dispatched to the streets to keep things under control. But a scientist named Deon Wilson (Dev Patel) has developed a droid seemingly capable of human emotion and feeling, who comes to be called Chappie. When Wilson finds himself and his project kidnapped by a gang of renegades with their own agenda, they come to see Chappie as a means to their own ends, while he further develops his own thoughts and feelings. But things all come to a head when embittered soldier Vincent Moore (Hugh Jackman) tries to use his own monstrous super-droid to eliminate Chappie when he's set up for crimes he did not do. The concept of a machine developing feelings has been a theme explored many times before, but one which never loses it's ability to have an impact on the audience, and to make them care about the story and the characters more than they might have. With this, his latest project, South African director Neill Blomkamp re-ignites the formula again, giving it a more modern edge in more unstable times. In an unseen role, Sharlito Copley manages to elicit this effect from the android in this film, stirring the emotions and giving the film it's more dynamic, driving edge, despite being pretty average in most other ways. As adequate as the film was, I still felt a little short changed by judging a book by it's cover, as the poster to this seemed to promise something absolutely breath-taking, a throw-back to some of the great monster mash up robot films from years ago, and while it's not without it's fair share of exciting action scenes, it still came off as a little under-whelming compared to what could have been. Some other flaws include lead star Patel, who looks a little too young for the role, not to mention some logic/implausibility flaws present. Yes, it's a mish mash of other films that have gone before it, Short Circuit and Robocop springing to mind, but it's all done with just enough flair and heart, despite the flaws, to pass muster. ***",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"This is a great movie definitely in the style of Niell Blomkamp. However, some people might consider this a fault, as Elysium was a little off the mark. What is great about the movie is its style. They really went all out with Yolandi and Ninja (the main characters part of the musical group Die Antwoord). Hugh Jackman is pretty hilarious as a bloodthirsty war vet, selling his role pretty well. The technology in this movie is fantastic, as usual coming from Blomkamp, leaving plenty of ideas for the imagination to wonder about for the future. Of course, Chappie really makes this movie; taking something so technical and robotic, making it human in action. He really gets the feels going. I haven't laughed like that in a movie theater in a long time. Add to that the oddness of the characters influencing the development of Chappie, this movie is gangster. Still, 9/10, super great movie.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Director Neill Blomkamp after his amazing work at District 9 (2009) (check out District 9 if you haven't seen it, it's one of the best sci fi of the decade.) and not so amazing but still good work on Elysium (2013), gives us his next ambitious project, Chappie. So let's start with the good. The visual effects are stunning, excellent work thanks to the visual effects team and Blomkamp. It looks as good as District 9 (which looked awesome.) I never once felt like I was seeing a CGI robot. But the most notable things about this movie is the robot Chappie. I don't want to give away anything because this is easily the best part of the movie. Blomkamp adds a new twist to the usual robot-having-human-brain plot. It's new, original and fresh. And surprisingly there's some amazing humor too. But the movie just falls apart when it moves the attention away from Chappie and tries focus on other plot lines. It tries to have a drug related subplot as a motivation for the characters, I guess. I honestly can't remember a thing about this subplot, you know there's something wrong in your movie when the viewer can't remember a certain thing after a few hours. And it also have a Hugh Jackman subplot which is completely unnecessary and clichéd, and only increase it's runtime to 2 hours. The movie drags a lot and would have been better if 20-30 mins were cut out. And also what the hell is this ending song? Seriously, It's horrible. All in all, the movie is above average and had some really great ideas and awesome visuals effects. But it's too long and focused on clichéd and dull subplots instead of Chappie himself. This feels like the shitty version of District 9. 6/10.",Chappie,2015,Western
IMDb,False,"Like so many people I really enjoyed Neill Blomkamp's DISTRICT 9 one of the very best science-fiction films in recent years that fused cerebral social comment with exciting fast paced action sequences . I missed his follow up ELYSIUM but couldn't help noticing from the trailers that it had the same visual look as the director's prior film , an opinion that seemed reinforced by the rather lukewarm reviews ELYSIUM received . With CHAPPIE my spidey senses were tingling that we'd be getting more of the same along with a pastiche of similar films such as ROBOCOP and SHORT CIRCUIT . Add to this a rather poor marketing campaign that saw parents taking their children to the film only to lead them out again when they realised there was violence and very bad language . Even the title CHAPPIE gives the impression the audience are going to be watching a twee Disney type film and you might just be expecting a massive own goal where marketing is concerned To be fair CHAPPIE isn't a massive disaster but is ill thought out on so many levels . First of all Blomkamp seems unable to leave whatever comfort zone he had in DISTRICT 9 . The film starts with talking head interviews and news reports that we had in D9 and it's only when the characters mention droid cops that I was reminded I wasn't watching D9 . We then get a high octane shoot out in a Jo-Burg slum and again I was left with the impression I could have been watching out-takes from the action scenes from D9 with the droid cops superimposed over the action . To its mild credit the film then does start taking on an identity of its own but here it starts to hit serious problems that have been mentioned - the tone . I can't emphasise how schizophrenic the film starts becoming . The titular droid and its developer Deon get kidnapped by some nasty foul mouthed criminals from the slums and these criminals are often incapable of opening their mouths without a string of expletives coming out . Later on we get a female crim reading Chappie a story like she would a child and it's like watching a mawkish family film complete with incidental music to go with it . I'm unable to emphasise how often this jarring shifts in tone happen or indeed why they happen . I think the angry parents who dragged their little ones out the cinema have only themselves to blame for not researching a film beforehand - this is an era where something can easily be researched via the internet - but by the same token this is by no means a family film yet someone bizarre segments suggest it might be CHAPPIE isn't a complete dead loss and I did like it in parts . Much of the film is helped by the casting of Dev Patel as Deon and he's always been good at playing sympathetic characters who have no problem getting the audience on their side and he continues in this type of role . Also as in the past director Blomkamp knows how to make great action scenes but at the end of the day CHAPPIE isn't a rip roaring action thriller anymore than it is a family film and one wonders what sort of film the production team were trying to market ?",Chappie,2015,Western

IMDb,False,"Walking into the theater, my expectations were a mix of excitement and curiosity, especially given the film's intriguing take on AI. From the get-go, ""The Creator"" impressed me with its use of the $80 million budget. The cinematography was nothing short of remarkable, reminding me of the visual flair seen in ""Blade Runner"" ""Elysium"", ""I, Robot"" and ""A. I."" The world-building was immersive, creating a believable and lived-in environment that drew me in. The performances, particularly the dynamic between Joshua and Alfie, were the highlights of the film for me. Their interactions brought depth to the story, and I found myself genuinely invested in their journey. However, as the plot progressed, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. The story, which began with promise, started to unravel. The pacing felt rushed, and the plot became increasingly predictable. I noticed glaring plot holes that were hard to overlook, and the narrative lacked the depth I had hoped for. The ambitious theme of AI's humanity, which initially seemed thought-provoking, was undermined by the film's inability to maintain coherence. While I appreciated the technical brilliance of the film, including the special effects and sound design, the script was a letdown. It was as if the movie wanted to say something profound about AI and humanity but ended up glossing over these complex themes, opting instead for a more superficial treatment. The characters, aside from Joshua, felt one-dimensional. I struggled to connect with them emotionally, this emotional disconnect was particularly evident in the portrayal of the AI characters, including Alfie, who, despite being central to the story, lacked the depth to make their plight resonate with me. While ""The Creator"" started off with great potential, it ultimately left me feeling underwhelmed. The film excelled in its visual storytelling but fell short in its narrative execution. It was a visually captivating experience, but the lack of emotional depth and narrative coherence made it a disappointing outing for me. I walked out of the theater feeling that the movie, despite its grand aspirations, missed the mark in delivering a fully engaging and thought-provoking sci-fi experience. It could have been a masterpiece, but a missed opportunity at best.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"This is a lesson to the movie industry on how to use a budget. 80 million dollars was used splendidly. The cinematography was amazing, (Not terribly surprising because Rogue One) acting was great, and the story was decent. It wasn't without problems though. The story moves at an increasing pace and at some points you lose track of what's happening. Suspension of disbelief will be needed in some moments. The theme of the story was to make AI to be more than just robots. I think they succeeded there, but at the expense of the humans. Most of the humans in the story ended up being one faced - except for Joshua. The dynamic between Joshua and Alfie was by far the best part of the movie. The acting was great between the two. It was a good movie. Not great by any means, but I'm all for supporting a movie that is trying something new. Overall, I think Gareth Edwards should be given some more projects. AND filmmakers everywhere should learn how a budget should be used.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"If the script had been as good as the special effects, then this movie would've scored a Perfect 10. That's because the special effects were absolutely beautiful and aesthetically unique. It's the type of sci-fi I love watching and which inspires my thinking on topics of the future and technology. Back to the script though... The script for this movie felt uninspired and I didn't care about any of the characters at all. None of them had any unique qualities, and the dialogue was all totally predictable. It was definitely written by a professional though, but it just felt flat and it took no real risks. Towards the end of the movie, however, it seemed to pick up a little bit, but by that stage I wasn't invested in it anymore. Also, the movie went on for faaaaaar too long, considering I didn't care about the content. So huge props to the special effects team for making me finish watching this film and not thinking it was a total waste of time, and that's the only reason it won't be unforgettable.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"The Creator is an original sci-fi movie written, produced and directed by Gareth Edwards (commonly known as director of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story). Lets start with the positives first. The Creator looks visually superb. They have really imagined a interesting future earth and used the production budget wisely, not over extending what is possible, and creating a curious mix of retro and future looking technology. The cinematography and location shots featuring the spaceships and battle scenes are really well done. On the negative side, the script is not very strong and we are not fully invested in what is going on or the characters involved. We neither see the bigger picture of this post nuclear reality, nor are we given significant smaller details and depth regarding the people and what they are fighting for. It is a bit of a mish-mash of seeing robots caring for children and animals and dressed as buddhist monks and US style imperialism (think post cold war foreign policy), with marines massacring indiscriminately while looking for 'the weapon'. We are given a nugget of thought when the Human / Neanderthal analogy is dropped in but it is never followed up with any real substance to carry the idea forward. Therefore we don't know who to root for and the viewer is left hanging. The acting is average and not great, perhaps reflecting the reality of the budget more than the excellent effects do. John David Washington feels out of his depth with the emotional range he is asked to give, and is eclipsed by the child actor playing 'Alfie'. Overall, it's not awful, it's a bit disappointing as the potential was there and perhaps another draft of the script could have taken it to another level. 6/10.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"Oh dear. I was really looking forward to this, and managed to get a ticket for a pre-release showing. I left disappointed. One fact that too many film-makers have failed to grasp is that CGI alone does not make a film. Effects can make a good film better, but they can't make a mediocre film good. Marvel, I'm looking at you. It's not enough to string a few action scenes together and finish with some really big explosions. You have to have a story - preferably one that hangs together coherently. This is what's missing from this film, whose plot-holes are more pronounced than the holes where the AI characters' ears would be. Just one example - our hero is on the run in an unspecified Asian county, where it's established that he doesn't speak the language. He breaks down. A van stops, and he's asked if he needs help. Asked in perfect English. That's bad enough - but then for no explored reason, our good Samaritan progresses from giving a stranger a lift to helping him through a police road-block, risking the lives of his five children in the process. Why are there gardens on Nomad? Why, if it's the last word in military technology, is it as easy to blow up as the Death Star or a Bond Villain's lair? The child-McGuffin is portrayed by an excellent young performer, but makes no logical sense. The nuclear blast in Los Angeles (seen in the trailer, so it's not a spoiler) is cited as the reason for the war against AI. There's one throwaway line about this late in the film - but it's just that: a throw-away line. Following it up would've led to a much more interesting film. I've heard it suggested that this should be seen as a metaphor for America's involvement in Vietnam, If so, it's a tired re-hash and forty years too late. Also, that would mean regarding it as an intelligent film, which it absolutely isn't Just one more big-budget wasted opportunity.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"Visual Effects, CGI, and Filming: Absolutely stunning scenery for a sci-fi movie. The effects and visuals were literally out of this world. A dash of Star Wars, a pinch of Blade Runner, a bit of I-Robot, a little Terminator, and an essence of Edge Of Tomorrow. I thought the Visual effects, CGI and the filming were all incredible. John David Washington: Absolutely a great performance. I remember him in BlacKkKlansman and just saw him in The Piano Lesson. Denzel has got to be proud, I think he is absolutely carrying on in his Father's footsteps and completely doing a great job at it. Watching this I could hear Denzel in his voice and demeanor, even though he has his own style and character. This is a guy to watch as one of the next big Hollywood Stars. Great job in this one. Madeline Yuna Voyles: Madeleine is the star of this movie without question. The young Actress from San Diego, California was 7 years old when she acted in this movie. Her first role and in my opinion she absolutely nailed it. Obviously a completely natural talent with an incredible depth of emotion at her disposal. She has already garnered nominations for Best Young Actress and Best Actress in a Science Fiction Movie. I loved every minute of her screen time performance. Keep your eyes out for this one....again, one to watch as one of the next big Hollywood Stars. Script/Writing/Storyline/Directing: Somebody somewhere mentioned swiss cheese.... I think the line was this script has more holes than a slice of swiss cheese. I couldn't agree more. It was as if each scene was absolutely perfect on it's own merit, but from different scenarios. Like a patchwork of independent stories. Sure the central theme was there but there was so much that just felt stitched together from different fabric entirely. I felt like everybody did the best they could do given the limitation of the direction they were led in by the director. Final Thoughts: I am a huge Sci-Fi fan. Blade Runner is one of my all time favorite movies. The premise of the movie is so time relevant given the current advancement of A. I. and Robotics. I just saw where robots are becoming lifelike very quickly and Elon Musk just said that A. I. has already surpassed all human knowledge....and that was last year. It won't be long before A. I. draws it's own conclusion about the human species being absolutely useless for the future of this planet. John David Washington and Madeline Yuna Voyles gave absolutely outstanding performances. This was a joy to watch and visually stunning to see BUT........ it should have been much more. This should have been a Blockbuster of a movie, a touchdown. The ball got dropped somewhere and my suspicion is in the script/Directing Department. That being said I liked it, I loved John and Madeline's performance and chemistry, but something was off that kept this from being the tremendous award winning Sci-Fi Epic Blockbuster it should be. Regardless of what I think, you owe it to yourself to give it a watch and experience The World of The Creator.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"First of all, lets get to the good.... The visual effects are truly world class. Likewise, both the musical score and Dolby Digital sound effects were top notch! Hans Zimmer and the effects teams did a fantastic job. The acting was also fantastic throughout for relatively known actors. Particularly the lead child actor/actress! Now let's get to the bad....
As a Sci-Fi lover and aficionado, I can't tell you how annoyed I became as the storyline progressed. It's like it was written by a 10 year old. A 10 year old that wanted to cram every conceivable twist and turn into one movie, which became increasingly unbearable. Completely devoid of reality. It felt like the screen writer had never really watched, or been truly into Sci-Fi. Do they not understand films like this are the bread and butter to nerds around the world (like myself)? The plot had more holes than all the cheese in Switzerland! Completely unbelievable from start to finish. Devoid of any actually research or basis in medium term science, which for a film set just 32 years in the future is crazy! Having not read the book, it's hard to say if this is the directors, screen writers or authors fault (maybe all 3?). Long story short, they completely dropped the ball. Both hero's and the villain's make it through countless and increasingly unrealistic ordeals, which simply take the edge off the great stuff in the film I mentioned above. If it wasn't for the great visuals, sounds and acting, this would be a 4/10. However, given those part were great, I've given a 6/10. It is such a shame. It could have been so much better if they hadn't tried so hard and simplified the plot. I hope future Sci-Fi screen writers take note!!!",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"In a world where a mess of a film like Oppenheimer is praised as a masterpiece and a genuinely well told story like The Creator is torn apart for minor flaws, one thing is clear: You can't trust reviews anymore.

Yes, it's predictable, but so is everything else if you've seen more than 10 movies in your life. This isn't the Sixth Sense. It's a moving and generally well told and acted story of redemption that takes place in an impressing array of settings in a thoroughly detailed and imaginative world.

However, the writing was, at times, terrible; even some of the acting, mainly the character named Josh wasn't good enough (the kid was great tho) It felt like some of the scenes were ""forcefully"" inserted just for the sake of illustrating something, even though they had no logic or necessity (a robot bomb that's running? Really? Why not just shoot the bomb like you've already done dozens of time?) And also let's not get into the philosophical opportunity that's missed here.

It tells the story of human v AI and our hero is a former soldier who is sent to track down the AI's ultimate weapon. Turns out the weapon is a child AI - who may or may not have the secret to his seemingly dead wife's location - and now our hero betrays his people to keep the AI safe and try to find his wife. His journey with the AI takes him deep into the heart of this world, and he eventually grows to care for the AI and rebels against his own people. It may sound cliche, but these kinds of stories need to be told again and again. By no stretch of the imagination is this corny like Avatar, this was a very good by the numbers sci-fi movie. Well acted, great special effects, good action scenes, and a big heart with a cool final showdown. Def recommended, too bad I didn't watch this in theaters.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"While the film boasts spectacular cinematography, breathtaking scenery, and top-notch special effects, it's truly disappointing that the storyline is painfully inconsistent. Despite the promising concept, the narrative fails to maintain a cohesive flow, leaving viewers grappling with disjointed plot points. The movie's visual elements, from stunning set designs to captivating photography, create a visually immersive experience that almost compensates for its narrative shortcomings. It's a regrettable case of missed potential, where the brilliance of the visuals struggles to salvage a story that lacks the cohesion necessary to make it truly memorable.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,With stunning visuals reminiscent of Blade Runner and the more recent Rouge One this movie is stunning to look at. Unfortunately the script falls far short of living up to its inspired cinematography. It's full of plot holes and cringe worthy moments from it's extremely one dimensional villains. The plot twist are telegraphed from miles away and there are no real surprises to be had. Everything plays out exactly like you would expect it to. Which is a shame. The look and mood of this film is almost enough to save it. But in the end it falls flat and its potential is wasted. See it for the visuals. Forget it for its script.,The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"The reviews of this movie are more misleading than I have EVER seen. Everything that is said is the opposite of what I actually saw. The 2nd or 3rd review in featured (at the time of this writing) didn't even get the gender of the child right, even though it's stated several times (despite the short hair, she's a girl!). Underwhelming? Void of emotion? I felt overwhelmed with emotion the entire film, and had tears streaming by the end. It wasn't just me either. I heard whimpering from a grown man a couple seats over, despite obviously trying to hold it in. Granted, I'm fairly emotional, so maybe not everyone will feel as strongly. But, this is essentially a war movie. It is a war between AI and humans in the future, but science is not really the underlying theme. It has a definite Vietnam feel, and America is not the good guy (hence the probable reason for political reviews). There's also innuendo of anti-terrorist (read anti-Islamic) violence in recent wars. Take that and the lead is a Black man, his costar a young Asian girl, and the entitled demographics might feel a tad sensitive. With that out of the way, I went into The Creator with very little info. As sci fi is one of my favorite genres, it was on my watch list for the Fall. I saw and loved Gemma Chan on Humans several years back and was so glad to see her, in sci fi again nonetheless. If you like this film, I recommend that show, as the theme is very similar. She is so perfect that she was convincing as a robot. It added a bit of depth to this film, I thought, too, if you knew she had that role history. And, without giving anything away, Allison Janney made a great female version of the stereotypical stalwart military general. This is an anti-war film. It has some nice bits in there for those interested in natural history as well. The soundtrack is a little campy at moments, but is a huge part of the impact of the film. Speaking of camp, there is a little fun at parts (ie the dog), but it never outshines the serious tone. This is not an action flick that's going to make light of the violence. But, it's not depressing. On the contrary, it has heart and an optimistic message underneath it all. Plus, it was visually stunning. Everything from the aircraft to the people (including the robots) are perfectly designed and cast. The Creator is a fantastic addition to its genre, both sci fi and war movie, driving the culture forward.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"The Creator seemed to promise so much through its trailer, and although it is still a very enjoyable film it feels a little too safe and run of the mill. It's story follows the familiar tropes of humanity against AI, super weapons, chosen ones, and the reluctant guardian. None of these are overly original but they are decently executed in this film nonetheless. The emotion of the piece is a bit hit and miss. Even though the performances are good, particularly Madeleine Yuna Voyles in the role of Alfie, I just didn't really connect to any of the characters. This lack of connection and emotion is one of the biggest things missing from this film. There is no denying however that this film is beautiful. The natural landscapes are used well and the grainy camera style really adds a nice element. It also has a good score and the direction is very solid. Ultimately The Creator is a really solid sci-fi film, but it just feels a little safe and derivative. Perhaps my expectations were too high as the trailer suggested this was potential a more high concept and emotionally gripping sci-fi, when I don't think that is the case. Still a good film though.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"I do like a good sci-fi story. The sheer number of cringeworthily stupid details here makes it hard to watch? A few examples of an extensive list:
So there is this almighty KI developing the ultimate weapon in a secret laboratory. Its security consists of a couple of black-and-white monitors and a couple of human morons watching a sitcom instead while on duty. The KI thinks that hand grenades with a counter of 10sec are a good idea. Of course they will come back, giving the robots a slapstick moment of comic stumbling into each other head- or limblessly after being blasted. The escape in a rusty old pickup of undoubtedly american 60ies design souped up with incredible interior technology. The robots you can sneak up to and deactivate with an off switch conveniently placed on the back of their heads. Etc. Etc.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"I saw this today and was hesitating because seems like it got a bunch of negative reviews attacking it. Seems like everyone was more biased because of their dislike for AI or their cliche Terminator reference. What I saw is a story about hope and maybe one last chance of some kind of redemption. This is one of the better science fiction movies to come out in years. People were mentioning plot holes but I think it was at a decent enough pace where some folks complaining maybe weren't intelligent enough to follow along. Otherwise it's a pretty intelligent storyline about certain parts of society and it's tolerance for understanding. The relationship between soldier Joshua and Alphie was done effectively humane. Now I won't go too much into the why or what's revealed because that plays a vital part of the story, especially during the third act. Overall, I found this to be visually stunning with some of the greatest special effects in movies. John David Washington and Madeline Voyles carry the film's storyline. Both bring an effective humanity to the world they inhabit.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"Fairly entertaining, good effects, but that's about it. I had big hopes for this film but it's just an average sci-fi flick at the end of the day. The main problem is it doesn't have a particularly compelling story and I found myself not really caring for the characters. They're just not given much depth and the script is also very basic. There are several plot holes or things that just don't make sense too. However it does look a bit different to other sci-fi films, the locations are interesting, and the action, effects and sound are all done well. So a mildly entertaining two hours but don't go in with high expectations.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"I watched this from start to finish without being drawn into the story at any point. I think John Washington is miscast here, I had the same exact experience when i watched Tenet... found myself very disconnected as I he didn't seem to make a proper connection with the role he was portraying. That is not to say the film isn't without issues. They have been fairly well documented by other reviewers so I'll not labour the points here. My main issue is with the lack of emotional involvment with the characters. The film measures zero on the emtional richter scale, but more, the screenplay just doesn't manage to get you excited or involved with anything that is unfolding. Additionally, the characters seem to have little connection to each other. In fact it is only at the end of the movie that Joshua and Alphie seem to have any tangible emotional cohesion. Contrast this with The Golden Child 1986 where Eddie Murphy plays Chandler Jarrell and the connection he makes to The Golden Child played by J. L. Reate. Here you can see what a great connection is established on screen and the massive difference in outcome it produces. Both films have two similar sets of pairings in almost identical scenarios with a stark contrast in outcome. Additionally Thought the film is incredible to look at, much of what unfolds makes no sense. I'd liken this film to an iconic fashion show where the crowd Oohs and Aahs at the fantastic creations that unfold on the runway, that no one (bar Lady Gaga) would ever be caught dead in at a normal social event. Anyway, for me the film was a big dissapointment, I can't say John David Washington was the cause of this since the Movie has many other problematic aspects, but the ones I've mentioned were particularly significant for me. 5/10 sadly.",The Creator,2023,Western
IMDb,False,"7 years on from his last big screen venture with the phenomenal Rogue One, The Creator isn't quite the comeback I had hoped for director Gareth Edwards. Visually, it's stunning with all of Edwards' 1980s science fiction influences on full display, but it often feels conflicted in tone and the subject matter it's trying to tackle, especially in today's world. Edwards pushes the relatable ordinariness of the androids and hybrid ""simulants"", but the potential menace of A. I. inescapably looms over the movie's head. For all its spectacular set pieces, detailed depth in its design and jaw-dropping imagery, the writing pulls the rug out from what could have been a modern sci-fi classic.",The Creator,2023,Western

The focus is steadfast on the question around whether AI is truly alive or just programming. My only critique is that it is slightly rushed.

IMDb,False,"In what seems to be the near future, a married couple and their young daughter deal their ""techno-sapien"" android/nanny Yang ceasing to function. As the husband tries to get him (note, not ""it"") refurbished, he learns more about Yang's life, both with his family and the one before he met them. ""Technos"" like Yang are equipped with memory that allow them to record a few seconds each day, and in some of the film's finest moments, the husband gains access to these. It's touching to see what was notable to Yang, who is more human-like (or even Christ-like) than machine, and Kogonada explores what it means to be a conscious organism in a world where technology could possibly create consciousness. Despite the premise, After Yang seems to deal more with death and the loss of a gentle person in one's life than it does with the traditional themes of robots in science fiction. It certainly doesn't pursue some of the more interesting angles, e.g. The privacy breach Yang represents. When the company ""recycles"" technos, you see, it has access to a massive amount of information about the family they were with. We see that Yang is warm and gentle, in direct contrast to specter of a high-tech Big Brother or the cool, emotionless tension we see in the parents, and it made me wonder whether it was possible to create organisms that are better than humans, and not the apocalyptic Terminator type devices seen elsewhere. It's all a very interesting concept, but I'm not sure Kogonada did as much with it as he could have. He also moves this film along at too slow a pace, one bordering on pretentiousness. The wonderful dance sequence in the opening credits and Mitski's cover of Glide help breathe life into it, but not enough for me to truly love this film. Maybe more perspective from the little girl or mother, or maybe letting up on the brake to allow for more of development in the story would have done it for me. Worth seeing though.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"""There's no something without nothing."" When Yang - a lifelike, artificially intelligent android - abruptly stops functioning, a father's quest to repair him eventually becomes one of existential introspection and contemplating his own life, as it passes him by. After Yang is Kogonada's second feature after Columbus. I haven't seen Columbus but it's become a must see in the indie feature selection from the past few years. Foreign to his style and skills, I found his work to be masterful. Firstly, the script, based on a short story, is incredibly thought provoking. It plays heavy on the ethics of life and technology leaving us to wonder if an A. I. is worth saving. Filled to the brim with beautiful moments, everything is bittersweet and sentimental. One of the big aspects is memories. Kogonada writes and execute this memories much like how our mind process them. Little things repeat and change to bring out the correct portrayal. At first it feels like your mind processed the scene wrong but quickly you'll pick up on that. Another thing I loved is the camera placement throughout. He has the vision of what we should be looking at specifically, even if it's not the focus of the scene, and it all flows together nicely. The cinematography is stunning, popping with life and great production design. The score is also really beautiful. Colin Farrell has a difficult character to play. The complexity of managing a different persona from actual growing feelings is hard to convey with what the film deals with. There's a few scenes he nails perfectly. Hayley Lu Richardson does well in her smaller role. We slowly learn who she is and how she fits into this story. Once we find out the full story, it's emotional and profound. Justin H. Min as Yang only has a few scenes but his presence is felt throughout. Most of his dialogue is poetic and adds so much to his character. The film is never too on the nose or explains everything to the audience. We're piecing details and thoughts together just as much as they are. This is a slow burn. Sometimes the pacing falls flat within scenes. As everything progresses, it's hard not to be mesmerized by the topics and story as a whole. I really want to read the short story now. Though the film may end on a note that doesn't work for everyone, I think it ends at the perfect moment. The last few scenes are a knock out. I'm really pleased with After Yang and want to rewatch it again. Earnest and profound, it'll be hard to forget.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"If it's not your cup of tea, I can understand because the movie is slow despite only being about 1,5 hours, but to immediately give it a rating below 5 is honestly childish. The story discusses so many important and philosophical questions and it does so in a very organized and beautiful way, with fantastic cinematography and solid acting. With a complex story where dialogue is fewer than in most films, you need to make sure the viewer can easily understand what you're point is. I think this flaw is the reason that some people dislike it so much that they give a movie such a low score even though it is so well crafted and emotionally touching. This is in part because of Colin Farrell, who gives a bit of a vague and neutral performance, but also it's because of the general style of the film. The shots are slow and often silent or with sparse dialogue. However, the words are so intentional and accompanied by lots of visual info in order to make the message clear. So instead of a matter of ""being boring"" or ""pointless"", it might just be a matter of some people missing the point. On a brighter note: fantastic acting by Justin Min (playing the AI 'sibling/companion' Yang). He perfectly walked the line between acting as though you're essentially a robot yet providing loads of micro-expressions to make you believe he is an AI that would pass the Turing test. The movie contains a lot of topics: it's about grief, belonging, ethical and moral questions, relational problems, human consciousness vs AI, xenophobia/racism, cultural identity and more. Therefore alone, this movie is worth the watch, especially for those who like to think about life and the human experience. With this many topics, a movie can easily become overly convoluted or messy, but the aesthetically pleasing shots combined with conscientiously written dialogue and script managed to stay clear. It truely saddens me how much the point was missed by some reviews of people who obviously disliked the movie. However, I would advise them to watch a different genre. This movie isn't your run of the mill, adrenaline fueled scifi bots-with-guns movie. It's a soft, carefully detailed and slow exploration of touching themes for those who are open to the experience.",After Yang,2021,Western

Then the android breaks, leaving the family, but mostly the little girl, bereaved. It is up to Farrell's character to understand why it broke, untangle the complex rules of service and/or replacement in a corporate ruled world and also discover who their android actually was. At no moment does the film hit you over the head with anything. Ideas are subtle, although not too much, seeing that I caught on to them. At its core the film examines deep concepts like the meaning and worth of one's life, the value of connection, but in a way that brings a lot to the discussion, yet not forcing an answer. It poses questions in the form of characters dealing with stuff and there is no definite closure, although they all reach some sort of higher understanding. I would like to tell you that I loved the film, but it had its issues as well. One of them is that it was kind of slow. Everything was meticulously planned and beautifully shot, but consider that this is barely one hour and a half and felt a lot longer. Indeed, it is based on a short story so either the writer/director had to add a lot more to the story or instead focus on style and art form.

Set in the not-too-distant future, an android helps a family raise their child. The android suddenly malfunctions and the family struggles to get him working again. Along the way, their relationships evolve, they learn about the android's personal life, and their understandings of existence deepen. Existentialism, significance, and love are delicately considered, feeling genuine yet rich. Despite announcing very little, After Yang evokes powerful emotions that will have viewers contemplating what really matters. True to science fiction, the film is philosophical, psychological, and dramatic. Meanwhile, After Yang's filmmaking is equally poised. The effects are sleek and supportive, adding fantastical touches to the subdued atmosphere. The music is tranquil and ambient, harmonizing the tone. The production blends naturalistic with futuristic, creating a relatable and optimistic world. The sound is peacefully environmental with dashes of technological. Plus, the cinematography is still and picturesque, subtly emphasizing simplicity. The visuals also utilize spacing, colors, and focus to suggest meaning.

IMDb,False,"Like with his previous feature, COLUMBUS, Director Kogonada has fashioned an evocative tale about communication. Taking the form of a sci-fi film, AFTER YANG concerns a married couple, Jake (Colin Farrell) and Kyra (Jodi Turner-Smith), who have adopted a Chinese girl Mika (Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja). In this unspecified future, a family can employ a surrogate android sibling, here named Yang (Justin Min). Yang acts not only as an older brother, but as a tutor who gives Mika a richer understanding of her Chinese heritage. When Yang malfunctions, the parents scramble to repair him, during which time they are able to 'plug in' to his memory chip. Kogonada (who also adapted the script from an Alexander Weinstein short story) isn't that interested in the hardware that makes up Yang, but, his inner ""thoughts"" - his very notion of existence (the science fiction elements are handled quite well). What's fascinating here is that this is truly a two-way interaction - the family is as tied emotionally to Yang as the robot is in its role as an adopted family member. Haley Lu Richardson plays Ada, another character who's questioning her own existential being. AFTER YANG may seem like heavy going, but, Kogonada and the wonderful cast present the tale in a most simple, unaffected manner. Lessons aren't delivered, but experienced. Some of the most sublime moments are as simple as drinking a glass of water. The viewer takes from the movie what they bring to it. Kogonada leaves it up the audience to decide what Yang's very being represents -- and how humans will accept that autonomy.",After Yang,2021,Western

In the not-too-distant future, Jake and Kyra live with their adoptive Chinese daughter Mika and Yang, a robot sibling responsible for teaching her about Chinese culture. Being a second-hand-sold outdated model, Yang breaks down. Jake sets off to repair Yang before his body decomposes. Writer-director Kogonada, who began his career making film criticism video essays online, raises more big questions than he answers. AI, the meaning of artificial life, and whether machines have a soul are topics that have been explored before in other sci-fi films. Explores the topics in a style of its own. What's fresh about Kogonada's take is that the story examines its sci-fi themes through the prism of a family unit. Does accepting a robot as part of your family make him a family member? Is the robot able to give back the love you're giving to it? Or because you programmed it to? Does it even matter? The sci-fi themes mix in with the family themes. We are all familiar with grieving the death of a pet goldfish or a grandparent, but how does one go about grieving a robot that may or may not be repaired? From that point onwards, the film asks questions in places we have never thought about. The production design was intriguingly unique. Kogonada envisions the future as a multicultural world dominated by Zen Buddhism and futuristic minimalism. Everyone dresses in Asian garb and lives quietly in a minimalist Zen decor home complete with their courtyard and travels in automated cars going under Elon Musk-esque tunnels. The story's conflict aside, it is practically a utopia. Watching After Yang was like aromatherapy. Kogonada speaks in little hints, traces of scent, and moods. It was like visiting an incense store, sampling a series of smells, and pondering what each incense stick makes me think of. The film patiently built its center of gravity, and I slowly pulled into its orbit and watched it in a reflective, thoughtful daze, contemplating my answers to its questions. After Yang gives as much as the audience puts into it. It's not for everybody and someone who doesn't participate may find that nothing much happens in After Yang. I liked what I got out of it and it was a satisfying one-time watch.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"Is everyone but the little girl a robot? Colin Farrell and Jodie Turner-Smith have zero chemistry or appearance of a meaningful relationship. They don't seem like parents. They seem like robot care-takers, like in Raised by Wolves. The Sci-Fi elements are... dumb. Like the utterly pointless scene of Farrell trying to guess the right sequence of command words to an AI in a world with completely sentient robots. Make up your mind, can AI in this world understand natural human speech, or can it not? It all feels very ""Boomer"". This is the worst thing I've ever seen connected to A24.",After Yang,2021,Western

IMDb,False,"After Yang is a high quality indie scifi movie. The movie exams many topics of what constitutes, a family and life vs property etc. It does it thru exploring various characters memories. It is slow paced and can be confusing. It never states a real story but it does give you insight into various question and gives good depth to the characters so the entertainment value will vary greatly depending on audience. It wasn't my favorite and I won't be recommending to most of my friends but I am sure some people will love it.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"In 2017 I decided to watch the nominees of most of the well-known award ceremonies and the Independent spirits awards had multiple nominations including best first feature, best first screenplay and best cinematography for the movie ""Columbus"". That was the most pleasant surprise I had that year because unlike most of the other films I've heard for the first time by checking those lists, ""Columbus"" blew me away by its visual language. It said a ton even when the movie itself stayed simple and didn't rely too much on exposition. So, I was excited about Kogonada's second feature and he completely delivered. There have been many films that ask questions about the existence and consciousness of artificial beings. Most of them explore a bigger story where this plot point will be used for dramatic effect and the twists and turns in the plot. But none have felt as heartfelt and poignant as this one. The film feels so personal as most of the film occurs inside a house. Unlike ""Columbus"" where he explored the architecture of that small town to show the dreams and confusions of the characters, here Kogonada uses the confines inside an elegantly designed house to show the barriers and connections between the family members. The film explores themes like what constitutes a family, what makes someone human, what is memories, what is beyond our existence as we know it, and about the ability of the human mind to love and hate anything without seemingly needing any logic, etc. It also shows various ways people would choose to mourn a beloved person. Some of it is seen directly as part of the story and some are shown partially and leave the audience to work it out themselves.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"After Yang is a good drama with a strong emphasis on grief. Combined with a very strong soundtrack and great performances it comes together as a slow, mesmerizing movie about being in a state of mind of loss and sadness. It's weakness is that it feels somewhat underdeveloped, and the balance between characters is off. Directing wise it's strong, it's mostly framed really nicely, nothing crazy. But the framing combined with the set design allows for most of the shots to capture a feeling that embodies the scene. The highpoint(s) of the movie are the memory scenes, those are something else. You have to be completely immersed for these to work but my... they worked for me. Incredibly reflective, taunting existentialism, grief, loss, happiness.. you name it. If you went into this (kind of like me) thinking it would be this cool high tech world in which you get to explore this android and it's abilities, how he integrates. It's really not that at all. By all means Yang is just another human character. Which is the point of the movie, the android has become so interwoven, the characters haven't yet understood they see Yang as a family member instead of something you can just replace. It's that aspect, plus the grief after that makes it a strong story. The whole Yang perspective aspect is super intriguing as well, questioning consciousness. Just those shots in the mirror.. incredible. Incredibly though a movie with a subject like this, it never made me tear up intensely. It could've if it hooked longer on the strong emotional moments. That said, character wise, whilst Jake, Yang and Mika get their time. Kyra just seems like a constant nag, that never really got to shine. She had one scene, which didn't really go far enough. Ada (Haley Lu Richardson) which I just saw in the White Lotus S2 was a real surprise in this as well, a small role but she was great, kind of the same role as WL where there's this nuance, underlying emotional turmoil. Music is fantastic too. Great little movie.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"Absolutely loved this film. So beautiful in many ways. Unique science fiction drama with so much heart. Very emotional. Great story about loss, grief and technology. Story about passions and human life too. It's clear that After Yang is set in future but it isn't really shown or said lot in film itself. Great performances. Colin Farrel was really good. It was also really great to see Haley Lu Richardson working with Kogonada again. Beautiful looking film too. Really great cinematography. I probably need to see this film again to fully appreciate everything. Beautiful experience.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"... and after absorbing this you'll have an urge to wipe it from your mind as quickly as possible. What would you do, if your android blew a fuse, shuffled off immortal coil, didn't work and couldn't toil, in a world where you rely, on this very human guy, to bring up, adopted daughter, as you're too busy pouring water, would you take apart his mind, not sure what things you might find, open windows to its core, visions hidden behind doors, finding analogue interactions, pushed from binary transactions, secrets Yang had hoped to keep, or would you shut your eyes and sleep - as dull as ditch water.",After Yang,2021,Western

And because they don't have the right skills to communicate with their own spoiled child, it's handled very badly. When they have a guy examine the robot, they discover it has been recording moments of time. Lots of time spent talking about tea. Which has a long history in china, the culture, the ceremonies. And connections for the family itself. What will happen to yang if he can't be repaired? What will happen to the family? A very sweet story. The script, acting, the direction, the music are all done really well! The action might be too slow for some. Currently showing on the kanopy! Directed by kogonada.",After Yang,2021,Western
IMDb,False,"'After Yang (2022)' is an idiosyncratic exploration of grief. Set sometime in a future where both clones and seemingly sentient 'technosapians' are commonplace, the piece follows a man's efforts to repair his daughter's 'big brother' android when he breaks down after a virtual family dance competition. It's an elusive and oblique experience that never quite takes the expected route. This is both a strength and a weakness, as it makes the narrative more intriguing at the cost of accessibility. The screenplay is fairly scatterbrained, stuffed full of sentimentalities and subplots that never quite get the development they deserve. It's a picture filled with half-formed ideas, concepts more potent in theory than in execution, and it ultimately feels like it doesn't quite know what it wants to focus on. It also feels rather long due to the slow nature of most of its scenes. However, it's genuinely quite beautiful on more than one occasion and its core is undeniably potent. The general subtlety of its presentation, particularly when it comes to its low-key acting and self-contained story, allows the the affair to feel fairly grounded. Its unwillingness to remove sadness from even its happiest scenes also elevates it beyond the point of sappiness. It's typically nuanced and affecting in its own way. It doesn't spoon-feed you anything, making its messages (and, even, the mechanics of its world) all the more impactful. Plus, its quirks - as ham-fisted as they sometimes are - do often put a smile on your face. In the end, this is an uneven yet intermittently beautiful experience. Its underlying melancholy lends it a wistful charm, and its narrative is actually quite poignant. It's as unconventionally enjoyable as it is enjoyably unconventional.",After Yang,2021,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"Calling a film that's deliberately paced for viewers to ruminate over and digest, slowly, a boring waste of time is why some people shouldn't review movies. It's ok to dislike something but say something meaningful or maybe consider what the director was attempting to do. Otherwise, you're just blathering and wasting readers' time.

If you do I think you'll find something interesting, beautifully made, well acted, and worth the time you're willing to give it. It's a grounded sci-fi film that feels like it could be now; 15 years from now; or decades in the future. The story uses a family's AI companion to examine human relationships and how they may or may not change as our technology does. If AI truly revolutionizes beyond war making and medical technology into the human-like advancement of synthetics, After Yang feels like a close approximation to it.",After Yang,2021,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"'After Yang' is a good movie, plain and simple. My only negative would be how slow paced it is, like I definitely get why it is portrayed the way it is and it has its benefits in certain moments. However, it did take me out of events onscreen here and there.

That aside, it's a well made film; there's plenty to chew on in terms of what it's attempting to tell. Colin Farrell, Jodie Turner-Smith, Malea Emma Tjandrawidjaja and Justin H. Min all do good work on the cast, while both the futuristic setting and the editing are further positives for this flick.

Letterboxd,False,"49/100 No matter how hard Kogonada's After Yang tries to evoke a gut-wrenching sense of loss and forlornness through an existential dilemma about the emergence of feelings and core memories in next-gen androids, it lingers only on the surface of the thoughtful concepts it raises. Hampered by sparse dialogue, vacant gazes, and an agonizingly slow pace, the film's solid ideas provide a foundation for no structure whatsoever.

IMDb,False,"AI is inspired by British science fiction writer, Brian Aldiss short story 'Supertoys Last All Summer Long.' It was a project initiated by Stanley Kubrick and then taken over by Steven Spielberg who directs as well as write the screenplay. It is a mixture of Spielberg's wide eyed childlike wonder from his ET era with Kubrick's cold gaze of adulthood. It is a modern version of Pinocchio. The film is set in a future where the ice caps have melted and eradicated the coastline. Robots of increasing sophistication have become part of the fabric of society. Professor Hobby (William Hurt) has created an android with programme to love and be more human like. Monica and Henry Swinton (Frances O'Connor and Sam Robards) have a terminally ill son and take in David (Haley Joel Osment) almost as a substitute son to love. David as he is programmed is fixated on his mother and projects his love. When their son Martin (Jake Thomas) miraculously recovers and returns home, the new family of four becomes fractious. Martin is mean to David who cannot interact with other kids. It is not in his programming. An incident means that like a dangerous pet, he could be dangerous in the house. However Monica is not willing to send him back to the corporation where he would be presumably terminated. Monica cares enough for David to abandon him in the woods with a Teddy Bear who is also an AI robot for companionship and wisdom (his Jiminy Cricket.) From there David befriends other robots such as Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), a sex-bot on the run after being framed for murder. They evade resentful humans and journey to find the Blue Fairy whom David believes can turn him into a real boy so his mother can love him. David is a boy who becomes accepted quickly by becoming part of a family only to find that he is not afforded their protection when he is gauded and provoked by Martin. Once in he wilds with Gigolo Joe he is living in fear in a society where robots have no rights. Spielberg creates two sound stages for the middle of his film. Flesh Fair a gaudy, sleazy place where robots are destroyed in front of cheering humans but David pleads for his life and swings the crowd his way. Then there is Rouge City, A Vegas type place where the holographic Dr Know points them to the top of Rockefeller Center in the flood hit of Manhattan where he meets his creator, Professor Hobby. The final act set in the submerged Coney Island which is then frozen over in an oncoming ice age until David is rescued by advanced beings. I have to confess. I liked the ending. It bought an emotional crescendo to a flawed film. It moved me as it allows David to find he is the recipient of love and can finally grow and become human even if it is all a projection from the beings that rescued him. Without this ending, I would had found this to be a dull, uninvolving and grim experience. Humans treating robots like pets who are soon discarded once they are no longer fulfil a useful function. I understand that this ending was part of the Kubrick draft and not added by Spielberg. Kubrick finally showed his sentimental side.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"A.I. is a difficult film. Some of it is brilliant, while some is dire. The acting - Haley Joel Osment as David the mecha (robot) boy is superb. He plays the role with such intelligence and maturity - it's a real achievement and bodes well for his future (if he can avoid hitting the self destruct button like so many other child stars.) Jude Law puts in another solid performance as 'Gigolo Joe' the mecha prostitute. In a similar vein to his previous roles in Gattaca and eXistenZ, he's quirky and somehow detached from reality - it works brilliantly.  He's rapidly turning into one of my favourite actors. ""Hey Joe - Waddya know?"" The rest of the cast is very good but doesn't shine, perhaps because their characters were treated lightly and not fully explored. Overall though - good performances by all. The sets , costumes and special effects are of a very high standard. Until the last 30 minutes or so, the use of computer graphics is tastefully done and never feel like an excuse to wow the audience with some clever CGI. The scenes at the Flesh Fair (a kind of rock concert where mecha are destroyed for the entertainment of spectators) are powerful, visceral and in your face. The flying and underwater scenes were also very well handled, although not mind blowing. Now the downside, and it's a big downside. The plot is incredibly disjointed. I didn't expect it to be so obvious that this movie had been directed by two different people and thought Spielberg to be more subtle. There was apparently little attempt by Spielberg to blend his parts of the movie with Kubrick's to create a coherent whole. Instead what we get is a wonderfully dark first 60-90 minutes and then something reminiscent of 'Close Encounters of the E.T. kind' tacked on to make us feel good. As a result, the feel of the film quickly evaporated into a mush. There were a couple of chances to end the movie earlier (notably at the end of the underwater section) and it was a mistake to take the movie beyond these points. The poignancy is lost with repeated attempts to extend and explain the story in unnecessary ways, the scene with David's mother towards the end being especially contrived and saccharin. The sum up, this felt like two movies in one - an intelligent, dark and fascinating film mixed one that's formulaic, sentimental and cheesy. Because of this it fails to reach the promised heights and at times feels messy. It's ultimately unsatisfying and left me very disappointed, but not because it's bad, but rather because I expected so much more. As many others have said, I can't help wondering what heights it would have reached if Kubrick hadn't passed away. An interesting film, but rent it first as it's not for everyone.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"Stanley Kubrick made a career out of directing brilliant but unpleasant movies. The ultimate example is ""A Clockwork Orange,"" which I saw for the first time just a few months ago. I found it astonishing, thought-provoking, and visually brilliant. But my experience watching the film was not in any way a pleasant one. The film chronicles the hideous crimes of a charmless psychopath, and ultimately how he is captured and subjected to an almost unimaginable series of tortures. I suppose some moviegoers might find those kinds of scenes entertaining, but I do not. Nevertheless, I consider it a great film, and a tremendously important one. ""A.I."" is harder for me to justify. While not technically a Kubrick film, it is a Kubrick project that was finally directed by Steven Spielberg, following Kubrick's death. The result is a film that manages to combine the worst qualities of these two great filmmakers: it has Kubrick's obtuseness as well as Spielberg's sentimentality. The ending is deliberately designed to frustrate, to remove itself from any possible human reference point that we can easily relate to. At the same time, it's the sort of film that wants to be loved. There is even a teddy bear character that evokes mystery and awe more than cuteness. This awkward fusion of purposes left me feeling distinctly uncomfortable. I feel unjustified for giving the film as low a rating as 6/10. I just so intensely disliked the film that I have great difficulty rating it any higher, despite its clever and thoughtful handling of the concept of artificial intelligence. No doubt Kubrick has covered this territory before, in ""2001"" with the character of Hal. But he seems to expand on it in this film, which features two android characters, a child robot played by Haley Joel Osment, and a robot gigolo (don't ask) played by Jude Law. The behavior of these characters is so subtle and complex that I was often left wondering what they were thinking and feeling, what the experience of being a robot was like, if such an experience is possible. I personally believe that there is something special about human subjective experience that cannot be duplicated by computer technology. But this movie presents the opposite view very compellingly, and without taking the standard route of making the androids seem human. In this regard, Osment is spectacular: his performance in my opinion surpasses his Oscar-nominated one in ""The Sixth Sense."" There were moments when I looked at his eyes, his facial expressions, and I sensed an adult level of understanding and depth. Perhaps no child actor is better than Osment at acting creepy without being cute, as in one early scene when he startles his family with oddly forced laughter that doesn't seem to come with the appropriate emotions. He is playing a character who's supposed to pass for a child while not really being a child, and we slowly realize that he is in fact an alien intelligence with his own perspective and goals. Unlike a real child, he is not in the process of forming an identity. He already has one, and his only task is to fulfill his set desires and instincts, including his unbreakable attachment to his ""mother"" (Frances O'Connor) whom he is preprogrammed to love. This setup is not very conducive to melodrama, yet that's much of what we get throughout the film, which tries to cast itself as a modern reinterpretation of ""Pinocchio."" Since Osment's character is not a real boy, we can never relate to him as one. His emotions are as artificial as his intelligence, and no enchantment or anything else will turn him into a real boy, because he simply isn't one. Yet the movie tries to manipulate our emotions so that we do see him as more human than he actually is. This approach leads the film to lose its focus in the second half and put forth one of the more perplexing and unsatisfying endings I've seen in a long time. I don't mind whether a film ends happily or sadly, but it should not try to force a weak solution to a hopeless situation, just to gain a few moments of cheap sentiment.",A.I.

IMDb,False,"I was 13-14 when I watched this movie. It's a long movie if I recall it correctly. I was so moved by it's theme, so I watched it all. I had strong feelings of sadness and sympathy towards little robot David that wanted to be a real child and to have a mom to love him. And that little bear ...
I cried during some scenes. I don't think I cried that much at any movie like at this one. Even though it's a Sci-Fi movie it has a lot of emotions. I have never watched it again since then. It'll be too hard for me
P.S I don't get how some people can rate this incredible movie with an 1 ? like why ?
Of course it's not a perfect movie, but sometimes it doesn't have to be. It matters your feelings about it, because this movie is that deep.

IMDb,False,"A fiercely compelling movie, at first, owing to how sickly it is. It raised a few hard questions on the ethics of sentient machines but isn't heavy handed with them. Doubtlessly a bit creaky and heavy handed, especially with the whole Pinocchio subtext. But it's weird enough, and filled with so many vivid images of a grotesque future, no less brutal for the technological advances. I'm not saying it's not campy and kind of stupid but that's better than boring. As shamelessly ridiculous as this movie is, I can't make too much fun of it since by the end I was balling like an infant. It's hard hitting.

IMDb,False,"This has to be one of the most amazingly confusing films i've ever seen. You can watch A.I on two levels; you can let spielberg take you on an epic emotional ride, or you can really look at the film and what it all means. This film is a manipulative masterpiece. It bends you and pulls you in all different directions so that by the end you don't know what's going on. When i saw this film first, i felt dazed, confused, and abused. I think spielberg crosses the line in trying to make the story touching (although he didn't really need to try), and ended up making it sadistic. When you try to make sense of ai emotionally, it;s all over the place, characters motivations don't really seem to be thought out. The story is bizarre in places and unbelievable, yet you almost don't see it because spielberg is so adept at manipulating the audience. While carried away on the emotion and the stirring music, it's difficult to look at what's going on objectively. Ai makes you feel incredibly emotionally involved, yet there is always a niggling doubt about how much sense the film actually makes. Underneath all the dripping emotion Spielberg has laid on, AI's story takes unbelievable twists and turns, it has THE worst voice over ever written, and the treatment of the boy by everyone in the film and fate itself is so cruel and sadistic when you actually think about it that it is incredible that this is supposed to be a kids film?! AI has to be seen to be believed, despite how cruel it is to its central character in order to make us cry.

IMDb,False,"Kubrick was a genius. Spielberg is a genius. But, they are different types of geniuses and they don't mix or match. No genius can do it the same way, which is why the person is a genius. They best you can do is get another genius that has a similar thematic view. Kubrick's clever dark philosophical view simply does not match with Spielberg's common mass entertainment view. Spielberg was simply the wrong genius to complete the work. All of Kubrick's later works (even the one-off Spartacus) have a dark philosophical vision and satirical point to make. It's like trying to mix Socrates with Nietzsche or even Aristotle. They're all great, but very different. The decision to use Spielberg was too superficial (""who's recognized as the best film director right now, generally speaking?...""). It didn't work, not because of Spielberg's genius movie-making technical skills, it didn't work because of Spielberg's lack of the dark philosophical satirical vision. Spielberg is a genius at making a movie that wows an audience; Kubrick is a genius at making a movie, perhaps a satire, with a dark view of or exposition of ironic hypocrisy, in human beings and society. Just look at the expressions of George C. Scott in ""Dr. Strangelove"" in the war room. A manly sophisticated general, with oodles of power, making childlike pouts and expressions. It's not meant to be funny, per se, it's meant to make a point. But you have to see it. And, that's all the difference in the world.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"I was sure that this would be a great movie. I'm convinced that Spielberg is one of the best of today's directors so a project like this should certainly turn into gold in his hands. But apparently I was wrong. It's not the way everything is shown. From the beginning until the end it all looks very good, even breath taking from time to time. The surroundings (especially at the end of the movie), the gadgets, the robots,... it all has been done in a way that can't be disapproved. But I need more in a movie than just some good special effects and cool gadgets. I want a breath taking story, I want to see real emotions and feelings,... and that's where this movie went wrong. It all looked fine, but when you try to dig a bit deeper, you'll notice that this is actually a 'sterile' movie. It never felt real to me. If you ask me to describe the movie than I would say that this is a mixture of fairy tales like Pinokkio (it literally refers to it several times during the movie), The Terminator (it's futuristic, has robots in it and shows how people react to those robots) and Tron (because of some costumes). The story is about a robot-boy that has been created to act and feel like a human. First his 'parents' love him, but than their real son awakes from a coma and they no longer want him. The robot-boy is convinced that he has to become a real human and that then his mommy will love him again. Because he has heard the story of Pinnochio, he goes after 'The Blue Fairy' who will transform him and make a human boy out of him, just like in the fairy tale. Overall this isn't such a bad movie, it's a bit slow from time to time and it never really seems real, but the special effects make sure this is still a movie that will be remembered. The only problem with it is that you know that it could have been so much better. That's why I give it a 6/10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"I'll say this with a sigh and I don't want to say this, but I was really disappointed with this movie. But let me explain how this film got a high and an above average 7 out of ten. This is what I felt for the first say, 1hour 45 minutes. I felt this movie was one of the most thrilling, exciting, sad, brilliant movies of the decade. And I don't throw compliments like that around often. Hayley Joel Osmont played a stunning, captivating role that is Oscar worthy and Jude Law did a mighty fine job also. In fact, the acting all round was quite impressive. Visually, well, it was flawless. The directing, the lighting, the special effects, the robots, all perfect, the music was moving and atmospheric and intertwined with the movies disturbing and oddball theme and it never failed to offer heart-wrenching moments and tense, unnerving scenes. The movie went along at a fast enough pace, jumping quickly from one section to another perfectly and hit all the right emotions that made you actually feel for the robots. Very symbolic in places, especially the FLESH FAIR which was a direct hint towards the holocaust. The future was predicted well, quite possible in fact and it wasn't too ridiculous to be imaginable. The settings, scenery and ambiance was just advanced enough to have a futuristic tone, but restricted enough to be possible. In a nutshell, this film is pretty hard to criticize. Well, this is what I thought, until after the scene that changed everything. *spoiler warning* I remember the start of the movie had an introductory narrative, explaining the worlds conditions and such and how the story would begin. Much, much later in the movie the voice returned, whilst David is submerged under water and pleading with blue fairy statue to make him a real boy. The voice returned in a fashion that the movie would end. The voice explains how David kept pleading and how did so for over 2000 years. At this point I thought this movie was amazing and one of my favorites, the perfect ending to the movie and a really moving and exceptionally thought provoking ending to AI. But no, Spielberg had to give us more. And a really awful ending entails. In short, it shows David breaking out of the ice 2000 years later and meeting up with a group of badly designed, unimaginative aliens that would let him see his mother for one more day. At this point, all the humans have become extinct and therefore, of course, his mother has died. But somehow these aliens manage to use bits of people to recreate the humans perfectly for one more day. An over-sentimental, over-emotional and a particularly ""Disney"" scene follows, that is dragged out, embarrassing, out of context with the rest of the movie, sickeningly happy and downright awful. This movie was always disturbing and off-the-wall and this ending is just a complete contrast that just does not fit. It literally ruined a movie that had the full potential to be a classic, yet the last 15 minutes, Spielberg did a ""fairy-tale ending on it"" and ruined it. I can't explain how utterly crap it is and I actually felt angry and depressed that something as simple as a conclusion can ruin a spectacular experience. A dark ending to a dark movie was the way to go, was the way to create a masterpiece, but Stephen Spielberg obviously had his way and destroyed. I strongly urge people to watch this movie, but I also strongly suggest you stop it after the second narrative kicks in. Until then, I would've given it a perfect 10 out of ten, but nothing denies that Spielberg made a fatal mistake. What a pity.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"This Movie is as Underrated as E.T. (1982) is Overrated. Steven Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick, Two of the most Admired Directors, combined Visions and worked Together until Kubrick's Death.

It is Disturbing and Delightful. Basically it is ""Pinocchio"", Restyled and Revisioned in a Sci-Fi-Horror-Cautionary-Allegory for Modern Times.

IMDb,False,"Steven Spielberg's latest movie A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, which he took up at the encouragement of the late, great Stanley Kubrick, has caused widely divergent comments.  And I can't help wondering if the most scathingly negative reviews of this movie aren't just an open desire to see Spielberg crash, as he had with ""1941"" and HOOK. For my money, Spielberg has done it again with this futuristic science fiction drama, regardless of what the negative reviews say.  Its story of a robot boy (Haley Joel Osment) who desires to be a real boy in a far future in which humans (Orgas) and machines (Mechas) exist side-by-side but not always in harmony is very much modeled on the Pinocchio story, though it is actually based on a 1969 short story by Brian Aldiss.  It raises some interesting and sometimes unsettling moral dilemmas that few films of late have done.  Can a parent love a child, even if that child is not real?  What might happen if that child desired to be real?  How will Man and Machine be able to co-exist? Like all intelligent science fiction, such as Kubrick's own 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Spielberg's own CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, A.I. forces us to ponder where we've been and where we might be going.  It's an incredible combination of Kubrick's icy intellectual and clinical mind and Spielberg's emotional heart; and I think it works exceedingly well.  But it forces the viewer to not leave their heart and brains at the door, which I think is why it is being so negatively received in this season of mindless summer movie fare. It may be too intelligent for its own good, and many don't have the 145 minutes of patience needed for the movie.  I did, however; and I would call this an absolute masterpiece.  Out of ten stars, give this one a 10.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,AI was an odd movie.  It contained some of Kubrick's cold intellect tempered with the Spielberg sweetness.  The two did not mix well.  I enjoyed the examination of human love and the story concerning the luddite view towards the mecas but the whole thing about the little boy pining for his mommy's love was way too ETish for an otherwise rather cold movie.  If the movie would have gone closer toward one or the other aspects it may have been more successful.  But to give the movie its due I must admit the special effects were very impressive.  I stepped through a couple of scenes with DVD slowness to try and discern how a particular effect was accomplished and was impressed with the craft.  The scene in the beginning where the meca's face is opened up was stunning.  I gave the movie a higher rating for its craft but I doubt I will revisit the movie as I have revisited Kubrick's movies. Maybe that is the difference between Kubrick and Spielberg.,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"This has to be Steven Spielberg's strangest film. Maybe that's because he collaborated with Stanley Kubrick on it, and Kubrick's movies are almost all bizarre. It was another of those films I found fascinating on the first look but increasingly unlikeable on subsequent looks. It went from a ""9"" on the first viewing, to a ""7"" to a ""5."" In fact, I didn't even finish it on the third look. Nonetheless, it's the typical Spielberg or Kubrick film in a number of areas, meaning great visuals, just stunning at times; a definite anti-Christian bias (that you see more and more in the carnival segment as you watch this multiple times); a very secular humanist outlook on life but a nice sentimental ending with the message that everyone needs to feel loved. Haley Joel Osment gives one more example of why he is one of the best child actors of any era. His role is memorable and just the looks on his face would soften the hardest heart. The first of the three segments in this film was hard for me to watch in spots as the innocent Osment (""David"") was framed for things by his ""real brother"" and then abandoned by his mother. Those are difficult scenes because the film is involving right off the bat. You really care about this young boy The rest of the film offers fantastic visuals and an interesting, but a too Liberal- slanted story, for me to watch again.

IMDb,False,"I loved this film. It isn't one of the greatest films ever made, but it's a personal favorite of mine. I cried at the two sad points, I laughed at the mannerisms of Gigalo Joe and Teddy, the super-toy, my heart pumped faster at the action, suspense, and horror, but overall, I really enjoyed the film on a whole. I didn't find an ounce of it boring at all. It's practically the same as observing an extraordinary life and extraordinary tale of a boy who just wants his mommy. But the boy is not a boy, and rather a robot. But the way he acts can pass for a human any day. The look of the film was dazzling and amazing. From the facilities in the underwater Manhatten, to the curvy, sensual architecture of Rouge City. I really felt as if I were really going along for a great ride and once I stepped out of the theater, I wanted more. The film is from Steven Spielberg based on Brian Aldiss' short story, ""Super-toys Last All Summer Long"" which was doctored up by Stanley Kubrick. The film is a tribute to the legendary filmaker, but it is not his film, but rather Spielberg's. Sure it sometimes tries to mimic his styles, but that's practically the same as a filmmaker paying homage to a great. It's more or less the same as somebody making his adaptation of a novel or maybe graphic novel, since Kubrick supplied some of his artwork through designs. The story is Kubrick's, but the film is Spielberg's. Although it may seem ridiculous to some at some points, it's a future, not THE future, but a rendition of it and somethings may happen in THIS future that may seem unrealistic. The film has a great score, but it just doesn't stand out like some of John Williams's other scores. The end could be considered a homage to Spielberg's ""Close Encounters Of the Third Kind"" or it could be something different, something more along the lines of the film's title, Artificial Intelligence, but only a far more advanced form of it. The acting in this film is great along with the emotions, visions, humor, and fright. I found this film to be extraordinarily superb, but whether you think it's as good, is up to you.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"When I first watched this film in the theater, I was greatly disappointed. I'm not entirely sure what I was expecting, but it felt so emotionally removed, dark and angry. The robots who were created to be as close to human as possible were destroyed at the hands of the ugly humans themselves. In a lot of ways the HBO t.v. Show ""Westworld"" owes a lot to this film (conversely, maybe this movie owes something to the Crichton book). Because Spielberg is asking us to apply emotions and feelings to things that cannot feel. Or can they? That is the question. The disposable nature of 2022-2022 has me thinking how obsolete humans actually are. Though our brutish arrogance cannot allow use to see us any other way. As the technology becomes shinier and more aware, we become more animalistic. In this case, David is a creation of a scientist (William Hurt) who suffers from the loss of a child. To prevent further pain of parents losing their loved ones, a surrogate child in a recreation of his own deceased son has gone online with a family that has a son in a coma. Monica Swinton (Frances O'Connor) is actually the core of which this story revolves around. She is the grief stricken mother who adopts the surrogate, develops feelings for it, only have to abandon it. Which leads David to search for her back. The sense of being a real human boy drives David to find the Blue Fairy so that it may grant him a wish. A false dangling reward to which, we as the audience understand the truth. Yes, this also taps into Pinocchio. A inanimate puppet made to be alive by a fairy who wants to become a human boy. A lot of the Spielberg tropes will pepper this story. The idea that humans see mecha as useless tools or enslave them to simplify our lives. Only to have them be used and discarded. The idea of family. The Peter Pan quality of eternal youth. There is a melancholy to this movie that most people will not enjoy. What is Spielberg's message overall. Hard to say. I think Stanley Kubrick took a crack at this story as well, and what they couldn't get past is how something that is programmable may develop a soul. It's something that doesn't exist in the explainable, but rather the spiritual. As I am now 20+ years older than the first time I watched this, my own mortality is in question. And it makes you have more empathy towards the zen-like soul of which most things do possess.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
IMDb,False,"AI - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four) By Blake French: ""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" is the hardest kind of movie to review-but it's also the most enjoyable kind of movie to watch. It's been over three weeks since my screening of Steven Spielberg's emotionally harrowing epic about a robot boy.  Before writing my review, I wanted to let its themes, content, and characters sink into my head and make a solid impact. The film was based on an idea by Stanley Kubrick, but when he died in 1999, Speilberg took charge of the project. I could spend pages discussing the techniques of Kubrick's intentions and Spielberg's decisions, but I will not. Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg are two of the greatest directors American cinema has to offer; it's pure pleasure watching their ideas clash and flow.	 I am not going to examine each individual theme here, either. That would ruin the movie for you. ""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" presents many themes on screen, but it's important to take what you get out of it. Whenever I read a review of Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" I feel influenced by the reviewer's interpretation of the movie's themes. Every time I watch either of those movies I get something new out of it. I hate it when other critics state the movie's themes on paper as if it's a fact. There is far too much room for interpretation to reveal this movie's message, or the message of any Kubrick film for that matter. Ask 100 people, and you might get 100 different answers. ""AI - Artificial Intelligence"" is that kind of movie-one of the year's best. Critics and audiences alike have torn apart this movie's ending-a clear miscalculation by Spielberg. If Kubrick were in charge, the movie would have called it quits about twenty minutes earlier in an unsettling sequence that takes place in the ocean. But Speilberg, who always seems entranced by science fiction, injects an additional segment into the mix that does not work quite as well, but isn't so completely awful that it deserves such harsh criticism. It still leaves us with an open, startled emotional disorientation. I left the theater with tears in my eyes. The movie before the conclusion is so complex, moving, and involving in so many different ways the last twenty minutes didn't even come close to spoiling the movie for me. ""AI"" transpires sometime in the near future after the polar ice caps have melted and flooded coastal cities and reduced natural resources. Mechanical androids have become popular since they require no commodities. Reproduction has also become highly illegal. Machines provide sexual services and if anyone wants a child, they will purchase a robot. However, the difference between a robot child and a living child is that robots cannot love. That's the task professor Hobby (William Hurt) of Cybertronics Manufacturing has solved. He has made a robot child that can love. We can separate ""AI"" into two separate segments.  I do not want to reveal too much about each plot because the pleasure of watching this movie evolves from the revealing of the connecting plots. I will, however, briefly say the first details a robot child's interaction within a family, and the second deals with the robot's estrangement from its family and the quest to regain the mother's love. I can imagine the material in Kubrick's hands. The movie's opening scene has a female robot begin to undress in a public office. Speilberg cuts the action before she reveals any explicit nudity. Kubrick would have had various shots of full frontal nudity. Spielberg, never comfortable with sexual material, leaves out much of the motivation behind Kubrick's ideas. One of the biggest problems in ""AI"" is the lack of edge with the sexual content. Jude Law plays a robot gigolo who lives in a sex fantasy called Rouge City where people from everywhere come to seek sexual satisfaction. The central character, a robot boy played by Haley Joel Osment, motivates every action in the story except for the scenes in Rouge City. Why contain such a perverse character and setting when his entire existence simply displays a mood that has already been well established.  Obvious, the filmmakers toned the aspects of ""AI"" down to warrant a gutless PG-13 rating-but why? The movie isn't appropriate for children anyway, and it's far too complex. Undoubtedly if Kubrick were in charge ""AI"" would have to be re-cut to avoid an NC-17 rating. Spielberg should have either taken advantage of the perverse material or completely eliminated it. Here I am, doing exactly what I said that I wouldn't do, and at nearly 900 words, I still have not clearly expressed my own opinions on the film. I have many notes in front of my that display my reaction as I watched the film, but I am not going to use them-they reveal too much about the movie. ""AI"" is a very personal film, a deeply moving, scientific, careful, and harrowing motion picture that displays startling talent on screen and behind the scenes. The special effects are extraordinary. The performances are alarming-the immensely talented Haley Joel Osment may once again be up for an Academy Award nomination. Go see the movie, then talk about it with others. It's the kind of film that you can spend hours thinking about, then go see it again.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"Heartbreaking, Artificial Intelligence is a Pinocchio retelling, a lesson in responsibility as well as in the dangers of prejudice, selfishness and emotional dependence. There are people who have kids for their personal benefit, sometimes monetary. There are also those who adopt living creatures and later abandon them. As conscious beings we owe the innocent our respect and attention. This film deeply affected me in my youth, and its moving story can hold great meaning to some viewers.

In terms of production, Artificial Intelligence is nearly peak cinema: cinematography, use of color, music and exposition… almost every detail is accounted for in this wonderful movie. As a young man, this was the first film I noticed had poor scripting: if actors are explaining instead of doing, if their lines are senseless, or if you feel something off with character or plot, then it’s often the writing. Had the director gone with a slightly less human presentation for the artificial cast (whether in physical aspect, vocal tone or otherwise), the film might have done better at the box office. As it stands, A.I. can be an uncomfortable watch, dealing with issues in an unflattering manner. The pace is less than ideal, and the plot suffers from the lack of urgency. Despite these setbacks, A.I.’s many themes, excellence in production and touching performances elevate it to an enjoyable experience for some and an inspirational one for others.",A.I.

RottenTomatoes,False,A amazing movie that shows that a ai boy did many things for his mom,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"This movie made me cry when I watched it as a child with my mom.  It made her cry too.  It's a very powerful movie that is very emotionally penetrative to certain people, particularly young boys and mothers.  You really develop a strong connection with Osment's character, David.  And even his companions, Teddy and Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) are very likeable.  The movie had a lot to juggle (such as emotions, technology, character development and the actual plot) and did so very well.  Being a 140 minute movie I think it could have benefited to being a little bit longer with how much there was to juggle.  It didn't feel like anything was missing, but this masterpiece could have been close to 3 hours and still been easy to watch through the whole thing, I believe.  I think Spielberg was a little too conservative with screentime but didn't have to be.  The main idea of this movie is very sensitive, you essentially have a boy abandoned by his mother.  This sensitivity is compounded by the fact that he's mecha, so the same support there would be for a human aren't there.  This really exposes the vulnerability of being a young child, and highlights the importance of a mother's role in parents.  Spielberg really took two very different ideas, and just combined them perfectly to explore a new realm that is often overlooked because of the family's or even government's intervention that acts as a much needed safety net.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"This movie can be quite moving maybe for East Asians, who study hard to face the college entrance examination. And it's very useful to watch this movie so that we and they can think about the temper we do to our children twice and it can make us love our family more, no matter whether our child is a robot or not In the end, Monica may not die but stay alive forever from another planet, and her story with David in one day after 2000 years may be her dream that controled by those advanced AI robots, but when she is awake she'll make some password so that robots on earth can't bring back her again, so you know it's entirely possible to continue this story to make a second movie after it, to finish our audience nearly 23-year cold dream (from 2001 to 2024(now)) with a warm and happy ending from when we watched this movie as children. What's more, I think David in this movie may have some Kubric's emotion and habits, in other words, David may be some parts of Kubric himself. Last but not least, it is not only about A.I., but more about ourselves, mankind, and our family's. And that love from robots is also a beautiful and unrealistic willing that we human should or may have in the future from writers of this movie.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,En la primera hora esta entretenida pero a partir de esa hora ya es un pestiñazo,A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"A.I. Artificial Intelligence - 9/10. Steven Spielberg’s A.I. is a tribute production towards his friend and contemporary Stanley Kubrick. Originally designed to be a movie that would have been directed by Kubrick, Spielberg took over the reigns using the script Kubrick had made specifically for the film. Its a futuristic tale that puts a spin on the old tale of Pinnochio. When a robotic child is brought into a home, he is discarded when there is a jealousy that comes about from the families biological child. As the child tries to reunite with the mother of the family, someone he felt he had a genuine bonding with, he ventures into a dark and grimy world. Interacting with various individuals along the way, the child and a robotic teddy bear go in search of the one thing they desire: love. Its a brilliantly understated movie, which some people have sadly overlooked in the careers of the two giants that were part of the production. But, its a beautiful tale of what it means to have emotions and feelings, and what it means to be human. A.I. was one of those movies growing up that I didn’t understand the true meaning on first watch. It seemed boring or uninteresting. It only dawned on me as I got older that theres a genuine beauty to this film, one that many other films can’t achieve. The movie isn’t one of my all time favourites of Spielberg, but its surely one of his most unique and endearing films (with a surprisingly dark overtone towards it). Its ending is so bittersweet, but truly tells you one thing: appreciate the fact that you have people in your life that you can love. Cause sometimes, the people that don’t have it, will yearn for it in ways that we will never understand or grasp a hold on. Love is an important thing, and if you have it in your life, cherish it!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"Steven Spielberg is one of the all-time greats and there’s no denying it, crafting nearly every genre of film and having them be smash hits to the audience. This movie really got me emotional toward the end and intrigued me throughout it. Haley Joel Osment is one of the best child actors ever and performed magnificently, and Jude Law stood out too! I guess one of my complaints with the movie was that it looked too bright and glossy and not clean enough (which is a common feature of many of Spielberg’s early to mid 2000s films, it was probably the cinematographer that he had around that time). However, that does not significantly take away much from this movie’s experience. In this day and age with true A.I. perhaps on the horizon soon, this film offers a unique portrayal and perspective on it!",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western
RottenTomatoes,False,"It blew me away when I saw it in 2001 in the theater.  It blew me away again when I watched it with my daughter 15 years later and just rocked my world (and hers) again on the 3rd re-watch.  

We've been on a Spielberg kick lately and A.I. still ranks as my favorite.  It's shocking how much 'Megan' borrowed from this film.  There are so, so, so many moments that will stick forever (I absolutely love 'Teddy').

This story carries so much weight and meaning on so many levels, along with the brilliant cinematography, music, effects, editing and pacing.  Easily one of the greatest pieces of sci-fi ever put to film...in my opinion, it's sandwiched between 2001 and The Abyss.",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western

Letterboxd,False,"A.I. is what happens when Kubrick’s brain and Spielberg’s heart collide. It’s cold, sentimental, cerebral, emotional—sometimes all at once. A sci-fi fairy tale that asks: what if love could be programmed? At the center of it is David, built to love. Not learn to love—just love, instantly and endlessly. And somehow, it feels real. That’s the paradox: his love is artificial, but it hits harder than the way most humans in the film treat each other. He’s basically a child…",A.I. Artificial Intelligence,2001,Western

IMDb,False,"As a sci-fi fan, I found this admittedly derivative film extremely enjoyable. It is stylishly shot, directed and acted with aplomb by the attractive and enigmatic leads of Theo James and Stacy Martin. Indeed, the latter is well cast in her role who is both ambiguous, childlike and yet empathetic all at the same time. The wonderful Toby Jones also turns up in an extended cameo just to give it that bit extra. If you want wham, bang, action this is definitely not for you. However, if you enjoy psychological, moody sci-fi with stunning visuals then there is much you will enjoy. It is very 'Twilight Zone' with an ending I didn't anticipate.",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"I didn't think a story about artificial intelligence could be so heartbreaking. If you aren't willing to be emotionally invested in this film then don't bother to start it. It has a good premise and some interesting themes. The acting is solid. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {SciFi, Thriller, Drama}",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"Not quite in the league of sci-fi brilliance as Ex-Machina or Blade Runner 2049, Archive has an interesting (yet familiar) premise that features humans and artificial intelligence. George, an A.I. scientist, is trying to upload his dead wife's conscience into one of his brilliant android creations. In the process, he has created two prototypes - a bulky one with the intelligence of a toddler, and another smaller, leaner version with the brains of a teenager. Both the prototypes (treated as sisters) develop a connection with their creator. George, however, wants to build a 3rd and final prototype which has the potential to perfectly carry his wife's sensibilities and demeanor. The story gets a little dramatic in the middle portions, with one of the prototypes feeling jealous of her creator's newfound enticement with his latest, brainiest android. There's also the evil corporate angle which only drives the film faster towards its finale, but what catches you off-guard is that incredible last-minute twist. It leaves the door open for repeat viewings and multiple interpretations. Since Archive takes the predictable route to get to this cracker of a twist, it doesn't get a rating more than what's currently assigned. Theo James is ideally cast as George; to think this is a film that's primarily about a human living in an isolated lab with 3 robots, James pulls off the stoicism quite well. His relaxed self in those flashback sequences with his wife proved to be an informal breather in an otherwise sober film. The production design and special effects certainly deserve applause.",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"I was just going to let this pass by, untill reading an interview with the director. Which drove me to this. First the good. Slow burning but not too slow, good cinematography, decent acting. The robots J1 and J2 are excellent. Character development in the first 2/3rd's is good. The last 3rd let's it down, the shock ending is anything but a shock and simply burns the first parts down. I think the Toby Jones scene finished it for me in retrospect. Nothing to do with his performance which is great work as always, but it demonstrates the lack of closure the film winds up at by pulling the same tired twist as other, better works. Hint. When being interviewed about your tripe filled film that ends with a tried and tested one, don't tell us you burned all the usual tropes in your search for originality. A pity, as the emotional nuances provided by the bots ARE really good, it deserved a more eloquent ending to match the set up, which is done well. A solid 7.5.",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"This science fiction film is set in the year 2038; protagonist George Almore is working alone on a humanoid artificial intelligence at a remote facility in Japan. He has three prototypes each more advanced than the previous; J1 has a childlike intelligence and an armless boxy appearance; J2 is more capable, has arms but is still fairly boxlike... J3 however has a far more human appearance; it is just waiting for its legs to be attached. J3 also bears a noticeable resemblance to Jules, George's late wife. Before the fatal accident George had Jules's conscience copied to a commercial computer system; this enables him to continue conversing with her even though he knows it won't work forever; the signal gets gradually weaker. As George works to complete J3 he encounters some problems; jot least the fact that J2 appears to be jealous. When I started watching this I had no idea what to expect and early only I suspected it may develop in similar ways to 'Ex Machina', which I really enjoyed... it didn't but I still enjoyed it more so for being original. The story develops in interesting ways and ultimately delivers an ending that was a complete surprise. I liked how the film is ostensibly about robots but in reality is more about the human condition and coping with the death of a loved one. The cast is solid; most obviously Theo James as George and Stacy Martin as J3/Jules... in most scenes these are the only two characters. The effects used are impressive without being distracting. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of science fiction looking for something that makes you think.",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"I expect a lot of people will compare this to Ex Machina, and for good reasons. Excellent story, interesting character development, great acting and directing, this is definitely the kind of smart, evenly paced sci-fi I love (if you're expecting explosions, lasers and flying car chases, you're gonna have a bad time...).
While it may be using familiar tropes and the occasional cliche, this truly is a 7/10 throughout that earns its 8th star in the last 15 min. Highly recommended, especially for sci-fi fans!",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"I caught this at a Drive-In double feature with ""Palm Springs."" I think that pairing made this pale in comparison. I will say that I was VERY impressed with the production design and the special effects; nothing looked cheesy or unrealistic (I haven't found any budget information anywhere yet). And that's about it. Theo James has the looks of a young De Niro or James Franco from time to time, but he (or his character) is quite charmless. It's strange that this reminded me of ""Moon"" so much, when you consider that the director of this film worked on ""Moon"" back in 2009. But that film is buoyed by an engrossing Sam Rockwell performance. And ""Ex Machina"" has the balance of Domnhall Gleeson and Oscar Issac's performances. Theo James can't really anchor this whole movie. The other actors are fine, but seem ornamental. This is above-average for its design, but middle-of-the-road for just about everything else.",Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"Another run-of-the-mill A.I. movie about a secluded man obsessed with re-creating life in a metal body. Usually those films can be thought-provoking and innovative. But this one isn't. And results in a dry, meaningless plot with boring characters. It even has its own abysmal attempt at the Ex-Machina dance scene. But with that said, there is one very good touch to this movie. One that's unfortunately let down by the other 95% (that doesn't allow it to have the impact that it perhaps should have done). A nice idea, but poorly executed. Also, this movie is a perfect example of how NOT to use a score (music). More producers need to understand that it's not necessary to fill every second of a movie with an over-bearing score in the background. Because in doing so, the viewer loses the ability to notice which parts of the film something profound, sad, exciting, revealing or exciting is about to happen. The whole movie is filled with futuristic sci-fi ambience music; making every scene/segment of the movie feel exactly the same. Not helpful when the entire plot of the film is already set in one compound with very limited characters. It makes the whole viewing experience even more boring. If the producers of this film need to learn how to use the score correctly, refer to Moon (2009) and how it used Clint Mansell's masterful soundtrack.",Archive,2020,Western

IMDb,False,The special effects and drone camera work are great and this film could have been amazing. A poor worn out story line about AI and it's usual drawbacks are given a slight variant but it's mostly similar to other movies with the same subject line; and requiring a single actor to carry 90% of the film. Moon with Sam Rockwell did it best and this tries to match the effort with sub par results. Perhaps we all can agree that this avenue is a wrap and move onto another aspect with AI movies.,Archive,2020,Western
IMDb,False,"Science fiction film / drama. Another addition to the artificial intelligence and robotics films, among which was Ex Machina, which focused on the pursuit of artificial intelligence freedom and slightly on romance, only this one goes much further. It focuses on deeper and more serious bioethical issues, such as how one could hold the consciousness of a person who has actually ""gone"" for a bit longer by storing it in the ""archive"", a system where one could communicate with one phone call. The ""consciousness"" would gradually weaken until it was completely lost. Through these calls, one could get more time and to properly say goodbye to loved ones that are gone. But what would be the essence of this consciousness? It would have e.g. soul, or would it be a mere imprint of the dead, memories, thoughts, images etc? If consciousness still existed could we say that the beloved ones are not dead yet? What if someone took it even further and tried to store consciousness in robots to keep their beloved ones? So the film raises serious issues for the first time and despite the slow pace that characterizes the films of the genre in general, it is a pioneer in the genre and has a huge plot twist at the end that reminds of the movie ""6th sense"" with Bruce Willis. Of the films of this genre, Ex Machina is clearly one of the most well-known, but of much value is now the much older film with Robin Williams, the Bicentennial Man (1999), which I recommend as a reference film to artificial intelligence. Although it does not reach the top overall, due to the pioneering central idea it is remarkable and recommended to everyone.",Archive,2020,Western

RottenTomatoes,False,"Theo James holds almost the entirety of the screen time in the movie, and he does a damn good job. It's no small feat to manage to keep someone entertained while being the only actor on the screen.

While i can understand to some degree the people that found the movie boring, that is, in my opinion, because of their personal taste, just because a movie is slow paced it doesn't mean that it is no good.

There are some movies that are worth to watch in their entirety only for the plot twist at the end, which is made up by mere seconds, and this is one of them.

RottenTomatoes,False,"Sadly, I only stumbled across this movie because it features actress Stacy Martin, whom I've previously seen in Lars von Trier's Nymphomaniac: Vol. 1 (2013). The plot of Archive includes well-known elements from multiple science fiction stories told a thousand times before. A male scientist or engineer lives alone in a remote facility, only to be accompanied by a robotic lifeform or a computer with a female persona. Mostly like he is a widower who lost his significant, and possibly children, in a tragic accident, the story will unfold as he grows an emotional attachment to the robotic lifeform or computer as we bear witness to his sad loss through flashbacks. Chaos will ensue at some point before the male protagonist must face the decision of severing the emotional attachment with the technological proxy. Sound familiar? The writer will tweak and adjust each story, but the thread is still present in these dystopian tales.",Archive,2020,Western

IMDb,False,"Seeing Atlas starring Jennifer Lopez pop up on Netflix doesn't necessarily leave you with a lot of hope that it's going to be a good movie, but I surprisingly liked it much more than I expected. It may not start off particularly strong, but it gets going and I feel Jennifer Lopez did a better job acting than I expected, and I do remember her doing fairly well at times, like in Out of Sight. Anyway, it really gets going after about 20-30 minutes, and the action is very well done in my opinion and fun to watch. Think Halo but even more action at it's best. She doesn't trust AI but slowly learns to trust the AI she is forced to work with and develops a bond that grows throughout, and I enjoyed that. I think many Netflix movies get unfairly rated poorly and of course anything starring JLo will as well. As usual, it wouldn't surprise me if the very low ratings came from people who didn't even watch it. I really don't feel if I was going to give something a 4 or lower, I would even continuing watching it and didn't feel I could give a fair review (unless I was in a theater with friends or family and had to sit through a movie I hated). Anyway, if you like action and sci fi, and go in for some fun not expecting some masterpiece, I think you will definitely be entertained.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"Was it great no!!! Will it hold a spot in the Sci-fi Hall of Fame No!! But Did it hold me and Family attention for 2hr sure did.. The CGI was top notch, story was nothing new,but in today's world where AI is real thing you feal a little bit closer to the story than say 40 years ago when Terminator came out..Jlo is no Ripley from Aliens but she tried.. The back and forth between her and Smith was entertaining. Everyone is entitled to there opinions but to say this movie is Trash just because Jlo is in it, is crazy .

IMDb,False,"If you are a sci-fi fan and are known with the Titanfall game series, this movie will be very surprising. It is yet another take on the 'ai will take over the world'. But since I am a big fan of the Titanfall series it was great to experience a movie that was set unintentionally in the world of Titanfall. Jennifer Lopez would not have been my first choice to star in this type of movie, but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by her acting. The relationship between ai and humans got very well portrayed by Jennifer. I even almost shed a tear in the end of the movie. Having said this, I would say that there is a lot of untapped potential. It was a good experience, but it could have been amazing with a more compelling story and build up. The story felt a bit cliché at moments but the CGI partly made up for this.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"**Movie Review: Atlas** Alright, let's talk about ""Atlas."" The graphics are absolutely banging, and the action scenes? Properly nailed it. You're on the edge of your seat, loving every punch and explosion. The storyline, though, is a bit meh. Nothing to write home about, really. Now, here's the kicker: Jennifer's acting. Blimey, it's a disaster. She's overacting like there's no tomorrow, and it just ruins the whole vibe. It's so over the top, you can't take any of the serious bits seriously. It's a real shame because everything else was looking pretty decent. So, in a nutshell, ""Atlas"" is a bit of a mixed bag. Great visuals and action, but the story's just alright, and Jennifer's performance? Total rubbish. If you're splashing out on a big project, make sure the acting doesn't muck it all up.",Atlas,2024,Western

""pain"" (grimace) for the duration of the whole movie... walking as if she had a stick on her legs and back (apparently it is how a ""tough"" girl walks?) was there no other emotion for the whole movie? The whole environment felt like a game rather than a real life/alien environment. It felt hollow, empty, rushed, but lots effort to do... what? Why would you destroy a good story with kid gimmicks, frag fest and a horrible actress? Keep her to the rom com where she was ok? I am even struggling to put this together...",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"I kept asking myself throughout the movie wether Jennifer Lopes character was adapted for her or if Jennifer Lopes adapted to the character. The story is that there is a war between humanity and a rogue AI. We get to follow Jennifer Lopes character attempting to destroy the rogue AI. There is a lot of dialogue between what is portraited as the good AI and Jennifer Lopes character and this is where the problem happen in my opinion. Her character is so immature, entitled and emotional that it ruins the movie. This is because it isnt believable that someone of high intellect would act like that and its just annoyying to watch. The dialogue between Jennifer Lopes character and the good AI also seems like an advertisement for AI because the movie is portraiting the good AI as a loyal human friend. The best part of the movie is Mark Strongs acting and character. He has a small role but does it well. The CGI is great and camera, music and sound is just fine. So you will experience some nice sci fi watching this. 6/10 For the CGI.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"Brad Peyton seems to be another one of these directors that Hollywood keeps throwing money at for mediocre formulaic movies, almost certainly written with AI now, trading on big star names & flashy soulless CGI. Jennifer Lopez is still just an average actor I hate to say, propped up by better actors around her. Using AI as a plot device has already been done so much better in movies since the 80's, but is now mostly just boring. It's easy to see all the movies Peyton is trying to pay homage to, but it's usually in the laziest way possible. The excessive time of Lopez alone in her mech suit, clearly just hours of her, green screen, & the director trying to come up with remotely interesting dialogue, is truly a test of endurance to watch. This movie will be forgotten within months.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"Why was Jennifer Lopez casted in this movie? But in the end she is not that bad. I am not sure why people are giving the movie a bad rating and saying its bad, first off the special effects are quit good, I just finish watching Parasyte the grey and those were bad effects. Lopez actually pulls it off, she is not like invincible or anything she uses her intelligence instead of her strength combine with Adam the mech they are a great team. Atlas is far better than Rebel Moon at least part 2, and is a great mech sci fin movie in the end its entertaining even with the 2 hour length. If you like sci fi and good FX give this movie a chance honest, I almost skip it due to all those bad reviews, its clearly not a 10 but it does not deserve a 1 and certainly not all the hate it getting.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"I just don't get what made a lot of people kept on hating J-Lo. Saying that she can't act, can't sing, bad hair, bad attitude, etc. And it affected their way of rating this movie. Their rating became subjective, not objective. I mean, I do know that she often acts like a diva on set. But as a reviewer of this movie, I'm gonna be objective. Unlike those morons with clouded judgment. Talking about her acting, it's on point. She really breathe the life into Atlas Shepherd. This movie is a combination of sci-fi and action movie. But it seemed to lean more on the action side. Personally I don't mind at all. Cause I enjoy both genre equally. The story is pretty straightforward and there is no major plot twist. And I think anyone can guess the twist at the end of the movie. It's pretty obvious. But still, it's a great movie, no matter what J-Lo's haters said. You'd be an idiot to miss this one. Especially if you're a fan of action or sci-fi movies.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"The writers latch onto a current concern: what happens if AI develops to a point where it decides it's time for us to go and it's bye-bye humanity. The special effects are good and I like imaginings of what the future will look like and what I will miss out on, unless maganuts destroy everything first. I assume most who decided to watch Atlas did so because they like a good sci-fi space opera and wanted to see how Jenny from the block is holding up. There isn't a lot new here as plot goes: madman (mad robot, same thing) is determined to kill everyone except for a few chosen; heroine is off to stop him. And plot twist (not really), heroine finds soul mate. The film is pretty much a one woman show as Ms. Lopez is on camera 100 per cent of the time. As she has to work in a confined space for much of the film, acting as such is how well Ms. Lopez can use her voice to create mood and sense of urgency. Basically a decent pop corn flic.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"For those wondering how Jennifer Lopez managed to get cast in the lead role for this film, a role she is completely wrong for...she produced it. Without giving one specific plot point away, it's only necessary to compare this to the Will Smith I-Robot film to know what it's about. In I-Robot, an imperfect movie, but a box office smash, there was a damaged protagonist who hated AI (robots) and allowed it to cloud his thinking and consume his life and career. When an existential threat of true AI dominance arises, threatening human extinction, the protagonist bonds with an AI cohort, and fends off the uprising and destroys the AI central threat. This movie really wanted to be that movie, except in space with a female lead. There is a real thing in Hollywood: you can steal a story if you change several key aesthetics. So, here we are. There are a lot of other problems. The most visible of which is Lopez. She's the kind of actress who some time ago encountered the nadir that many actors do: her status as a celebrity eclipsed her stature as an actress, and she began performing in a very packaged and self conscious way. When you can tell an actor is thinking about how they look in a film, that's not good. The other challenges? When a lead performer is as polarizing as Lopez there are many who will ""hate watch"" this, rubbing their hands together in anticipation of the imminent schadenfreude. And because the plot and dialogue is weak, they'll get their wish. It's further complicated that the director, Peyton (Andreas), is familiar enough with spectacle, but not masterful in putting together something that should be of epic scale. Add to those obstacles the glaringly apparent lack of originality in the script or character beats, and you have a patient that is Dead On Arrival. The script attempts to make the story of AI galactic domination relatable by focusing on Atlas's (Lopez) personal history with betrayal. Unfortunately it throws the entire weight of impending genocide out of orbit. It makes the trials of the protagonist feel small; and Lopez, not looking dirty enough or scarred enough, hits every mark we see coming from a mile away. Mark Strong, Simu Liu and other supporting cast members are saddled with similar story, plot and dialogue problems. What we get is another big splashy Netflix film that will be forgotten in a hurry; to be half-watched while doing chores or sitting on a plane. Bummer.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"I often leave the cinema if I'm not enjoying the film. It's supposed to be entertaining, right? So, I actually enjoyed this movie. It was an easy watch, I didn't feel patronised, or spend any time wondering what the hell was going on. I was entertained. The storyline was engaging, JLo is a pretty versatile actress, as long as the character is easy on the eye and uncomplicated. Tick, tick. I liked the repartee between Smith and Atlas. The graphics were fine, the fight scenes weren't overly in your face, there were no animals, so no animals were hurt, and the vegetation was interesting. And I think Mark Strong is quietly cool.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"That was one of the movies where I'm glad I wasn't sitting in the theater. Otherwise I would have mourned my money and left the theater before the last half hour, or maybe even earlier. I was able to fast-forward and wasn't surprised in the end because the ending was predictable, just like the whole movie. Doesn't anyone bother to write a coherent story anymore? A few action sequences and some CGI were still reasonably well done, but they don't make up for the bad story, the lousy dialog and the plot holes. In the beginning I still had hope that the movie would be reasonably good, but as the story progressed this hope also faded. A movie to forget...unfortunately. I give it 4 stars because the beginning was still reasonably entertaining.",Atlas,2024,Western

I liked this movie, and it doesn't really matter if the basic story is one that has been told before. The execution was done well and the acting was solid. The special effects are also impressive, such that if this movie were released 20 or 30 years ago it might have been hailed as a masterpiece.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"I had fun watching it. It is not Aliens, but it is good enough for an evening having dinner. I like Jennifer Lopez on screen. I enjoyed her in Out of Sight and Shades of Blue. She got better with the years and strong but difficult characters seems to fit her. For me Atlas had some flavor of ""Outer Limits"". The dialogs between her and Smith are funny and that a strong AI comes to the conclusion that the problems humans have are not solvable because humans are the problem is not out of the thinkable ideas. Tricks are enjoyable and the action is believable. It is to mention that she is not a skinny superfighter who knocks out 10 grown up and trained men.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"I have no idea why some reviewers are panning Jennifer Lopez' acting. Her emoting and physical acting, reacting to the intricate cgi environments and an AI sidekick named Smith (nod to The Matrix) is nothing short of astounding. For a Netflix original.film, this is a lean, action packed, often funny and tongue in cheek throwback that will make you feel you've been reading a late 5O's pulp magazine. It revolves around an AI expert sent into space in a last ditch mission to stop a rogue AI from launching an apocalyptic attack against human kind (his idea of saving humanity from themselves). In the.end, a story about redemption and overcoming prejudice, Not bad at all.",Atlas,2024,Western

All these things are better than enduring Jennifer Lopez and her terrible acting skills. I pity anyone who gives this ""movie"" a rating of two or more stars. Her husband Ben Affleck is a far superior actor. Don't believe me? Think I am crazy for taking the time out of my day to write such a horrid review? Watch this ""movie"" and see for yourself.

IMDb,False,"Greetings again from the darkness. My goal is to give every movie a fair shake, and to seek out the best elements even when a film disappoints. I don't recall a time when this goal has been more difficult to achieve than after watching this latest from director Brad Peyton (San Andreas, 2015) and co-writers Leo Sardarian (""StartUp""), Aron Eli Coleite (""Locke & Key""). Jennifer Lopez stars as Atlas Shepherd, a brilliant government analyst and expert on AI, especially on Harlan (Simu Liu, BARBIE), ominously deemed the world's first AI terrorist. We know Atlas is smart because she has a chess winning streak against the computer and she wears black frame eyeglasses. After an opening which features Earth in peril, we flash forward 28 years, where it's evolved into ""good AI"" versus ""evil AI"". Don't worry, Atlas is on the side of good, despite her constantly frazzled state (with perfect hair) and the personal (emotional) baggage she carries with her. After years of searching, Atlas discovers the location for Harlan, and General Boothe (Mark Strong, character actor extraordinaire) forms a team led by Colonel Elias Banks (Sterling K Brown, AMERICAN FICTION, 2023) to capture Harlan so his CPU can be studied. Of course, the mission doesn't go as planned and by the end, I was wondering which racked up the most points: explosions or Ms. Lopez's cringy acting moments. Terrible punchlines regarding a running coffee gag placed third in the competition. Since I admittedly search for positives in every movie, let's go with Simu Liu's unusual blue-eyed effect, the tight pants on Agent Atlas, and giant robotics that look like the one that went rogue in ROBOCOP (37 years ago). Apologies, but that's the best I can do for this one, other than to say we have an early Razzie frontrunner. On Netflix beginning May 24, 2024.",Atlas,2024,Western
IMDb,False,"Atlas is a cinematic venture that aims high and largely succeeds in delivering a visually striking and emotionally resonant experience. Set in a dystopian future where humanity's survival hinges on a delicate balance between technology and nature, the film crafts a world that is both hauntingly beautiful and starkly terrifying. The movie's strongest asset is its visual storytelling. The art direction and cinematography work in tandem to create a universe that feels lived-in and plausible, yet alien enough to capture the imagination. The landscapes, both urban and rural, are meticulously detailed, and the use of color and light effectively conveys the contrasting themes of hope and despair. The narrative, while occasionally dipping into familiar sci-fi tropes, is engaging and thought-provoking. It explores themes of identity, sacrifice, and the human condition with a deft touch, avoiding heavy-handedness. The plot twists are well-executed, keeping the audience on their toes without resorting to cheap gimmicks. Performances are uniformly strong, with each actor bringing depth and nuance to their roles. The protagonist's journey is compelling, marked by moments of vulnerability and strength that feel genuine and earned. The supporting cast also delivers, providing memorable performances that enhance the film's emotional core. The film's score deserves special mention. It underscores the action and drama without overpowering it, complementing the visual elements perfectly. The music enhances the narrative, adding layers of emotion and tension that elevate key scenes. However, Atlas is not without its flaws. The pacing, particularly in the second act, can feel uneven, with certain sequences dragging longer than necessary. Additionally, some of the secondary characters, while well-acted, lack the development needed to make their arcs fully satisfying. Despite these minor issues, Atlas stands out as a noteworthy entry in the science fiction genre. It balances spectacle with substance, offering a film that is as intellectually stimulating as it is visually captivating. For fans of thought-provoking cinema, Atlas is a journey worth taking.",Atlas,2024,Western

A Netflix movie with Jennifer Lopez (also producing) in a large robot-suit for two-thirds of the movie, and directed by the same guy who made Journey 2 and Cats & Dogs 2. Red flags all round, right? Well count me surprised, because this was actually a perfectly watchable and undemanding action sci-fi, which despite borrowing from much better films of the genre, still managed to provide a decent 2 hours worth of escapism. Being a huge fan of sci-fi, and being particularly fond of some of the films this one borrowed / ripped-off, including Edge of Tomorrow, and Aliens, this still delivered with some very entertaining robot-suit mayhem. Particularly impressive, was the sky-crash scene reminiscent of the beach landing from the aforementioned Edge of Tomorrow, certainly helped by the $100m worth of CG spent on the movie, and a very fun Atmos mix to boot. My only real disappointment coming away was that they had two great actors with Mark Strong and Sterling K. Brown, and yet they were criminally underused, especially the former.

IMDb,False,"There are many many many MANY themes to take away from this cinematic experience, perhaps it is abit too heavy for its own good. The story includes a cyborg agent investigating ""The Puppet Master"" which is a virus capable of infiltrating human hosts. So already we are presented with questions such as: What is reality? Could everything be a simulation? Do memories define us or do we define memories? We have creationism, ideology, afterlife...this is not for your average moviegoer. In fact films like The Matrix took inspiration from this, bear in mind this wasn't entirely accessible to western audiences at the time of its release. It's very heavy going and the script doesn't help. It feels mechanical, which makes sense considering it's a techno thriller and that our protagonist is an emotionless cyborg, but it's so mechanical that it just doesn't flow. The lead characters are memorable, from the no nonsense cyborg Major Motoko Kusanagi to her fellow agent Batou. I loved the fact that many of the humans have cybernetic enhancements and is something that could easily be real in many years to come. I adored the computer systems, it was very green and rather cyberpunk-ish...perfect for a film from 1995. The animation was fluid, although not Studio Ghibli, and still has aged well. There are some scenes with just background music and images of the cityscape, this really drives the technological style at its core. The English dub was good apart from Major's voice actress...didn't really work for me. This is a good hard sci-fi anime, although hard to follow it's themes and style pushes this above your average animation.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Upon Ghost in the Shell's release in 1995, the Western world was still largely unfamiliar with manga, but had already had its head turned by Katsuhiro Ohtomo's Akira (1988). Blending philosophical musings with blistering action, Ghost in the Shell captured the imagination of it's new audience, helping kick-start the Japanophilia that runs so blatantly through most modern Western cartoons and lines the bookcases of many a teenager. While it certainly has its flaws, this was the first time that casual Western audiences who were new to manga had seen a cartoon be as meditative as is explosive. And for those that didn't catch it, no doubt they would have watched The Matrix (1999) four years later, a film that arguably 'borrows' a lot more from Ghost in the Shell that it lets on. In the future, technology has become so far advanced that all aspects of life are interconnected through an electronic network. Major Motoko Kusanagi (Atsuko Tanaka), a soldier working for government agency Section 9, is a cyborg, and is able to access this network through plugs in the back of her head. She and her team are assigned to catch an elusive 'ghost-hacker' known as the Puppet Master (Iemasa Kayumi), an intelligent entity created by the government, who they lost control of when it became self-aware. When the Puppet Master surfaces in the mangled body of an artificial human shell, Kusanagi faces a crisis of identity. Disappointingly, the film begins with gratuitous nudity, showing off the fine female form (with giant breasts, of course) of Major Kusanagi just before she takes a plunge off a building to nail some bad guys. Manga caters heavily for its audience, be it sexually-frustrated, highly- stressed businessmen or horny teenagers who have no doubt been bombarded with images of giggling, short-skirted school girls throughout their young life. Thankfully, these moments are brief, and prove to be not much more than a mild distraction from the stunning animation on show. Things are grim in the future, but they're certainly beautiful to look at. The sexism aside, Kusanagi is an interesting character. When a man realises his wife and daughter are nothing more than an implanted memory, he fails to comprehend it. Kusanagi, with her mixture of organic and mechanical body parts and uploaded memories, struggled to define what it is to be human. Her hunt for the Puppet Master, who is seemingly a new kind of being, becomes a hunt for identity. Is it enough to be aware of what and who you are? The philosophy, although provocative, is heavy-handed. Conversations about humanity between Kusanagi and her second-in-command Bateau (Akio Otsuka) are delivered with a monotony worthy of a whiny emo teen, and I found the film's first half quite a head-scratcher. But things thankfully do become clearer, and the film is still, almost twenty years later, one of the best examples of the genre. www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This is single handedly one of the best animated films I've ever seen. You can definitely tell how far the animation genre has gotten in the last half-century. It's pretty much flawless in my opinion. The story, audio, and especially visuals are excellent. This is definitely one of the most pretty films i've ever seen. The philosophy really made me think too, the matrix tried this idea and failed horribly with it's sequels. This one isn't just for hipsters, if you're a sci-fi fan I couldn't recommend this more. If you liked this, I also recommend Akira, The Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex series, and the upcoming Steamboy",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"""Ghost in the Shell"" is an intricate masterpiece of cyber-punk fiction and storytelling, successfully melding intriguing philosophical ideas with a coherent, well thought-out (albeit) confusing plot. Even more, it's a nightmarish vision of a society that's dominated by cyberspace and looking back now, is eerily prescient of today's computerized times. Many of the characters in the film are enhanced, someway or another by machines, to help them get the advantage in a vastly changing society. I'll avoid going real deep into the plot simply because there's a whole lot to grasp and even I got more than a little confused trying to follow it. The story is that a team of high-level government operatives are hot on the trail of a notorious computer hacker called the ""Puppet Master,"" who is wanted for various crimes in cyberspace and has taken a particularly fond interest in the team's tough, female cyborg leader. Not surprisingly, as with the stigmas surrounding Anime', ""Ghost in the Shell"" is not short of nudity and graphic violence. But it's far from being gratuitous, and does not slow down the movie at all. ""Ghost in the Shell"" was one of the first Anime' films to skillfully blend traditional drawn animation with computerized imagery. This helps to give the film a surreal, yet beautiful look. And the dialogue helps sometimes too, with helping to sort out the confusing plot and many of its mythical ideas about personal identity and human evolution. This film is also even more revered today, in 2004, since some of this film's core themes helped to develop the plot basis of the insanely popular ""Matrix"" films, and some scenes from ""Ghost in the Shell"" were even homaged to in the first ""Matrix"" movie. The Wachowski Brothers certainly do owe a lot to this movie for the success of their work in America. I think that to understand ""Ghost in the Shell,"" it would help to accept that Anime' is much more complex and daring than traditional American animation. Most Japanese animation films, like this one, ""Akira,"" or Mayazaki's ""Spirited Away,"" are on a level of sophistication that will never be matched in America. It has been said that the majority of American audiences would be afraid of Anime' because of the many stereotypes surrounding it, but that's why it's boundless - it's been given free reign to use those stigmas to its advantage in developing truly remarkable pieces of art that have gone largely ignored here in the U.S. ""Ghost in the Shell"" could very well be a mere reflection or a parable of a doomed society that's probably already accepted its dark fate. Most American animation would never touch up on this sort of subject matter. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is my #3 choice Anime' film (behind ""Spirited Away"" and ""Akira"") because it's so full of ideas and is masterful in telling a dark story about our times. 10/10",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Ghost in the Shell is a masterpiece.  I would go so far as to say that it's the second best science fiction film I've ever seen (behind 2001, of course), but no one knows about it.  I find it terribly unfortunate that the only American viewers familiar with Ghost in the Shell are anime fans, many of whom overlook the film's complexity and see only its nudity and violence. The movie kind of gets in its own way-- within the first five minutes we see the heroine's nude body as well as a very messy head-exploding scene, and many of the viewers who would otherwise end up enthralled by the film's abundant style and intelligence immediately dismiss it as exploitative anime trash.  Every time I show this movie to non-anime fans I have to explain beforehand that Ghost in the Shell is a serious work of science fiction and that everything in it, including the adult content, is part of the point the movie makes about where our society is headed. The film is stylish, artistic, and beautiful.  Masamune Shirow's stunningly believable vision of the future makes the jump from manga to anime remarkably well.  As brilliant as the comics are, I really prefer the film version, which eliminates the nearly pornographic T&A (the film has nudity but it's clearly not meant to be titillating) and all of the exaggerated comic relief which only detracted from the manga in my opinion.  The film's action sequences are strikingly different from the overly stylized symphonies of destruction seen in most action films.  Gunfire, martial arts combat, and car chases are depicted exactly as they would occur in the real world-- without fast music or Armageddon-style hyper-editing or any of the needless cinematic baggage we've come to expect.  But it's the movie's ideas that make it great, particularly in the last half hour, when thoughtful viewers learn what this story is all about-- the emergence of a new kind of life form, an intelligent and self-aware intelligence that can live indefinitely without ever inhabiting a physical body.  The film argues that this will occur within the next thirty years, and the superbly ambiguous ending inspires us to come up with our own ideas of what will happen to humanity once this new life form begins to reproduce.  This is filmmaking that should be seen and discussed. And now the disclaimer.  All of the above comments refer to the subtitled Japanese version of the film, NOT the English dub.  Simply put, the dub ruins everything.  A good example is Kusanagi's wry comment at the very beginning of the film.  An officer who is communicating with Kusanagi through a kind of electronic telepathy tells her there's a lot of static in her brain.  In the original Japanese version (as well as in the manga) she replies that ""It's that time of the month,"" but in the dub her comment is inexplicably changed to ""Must be a loose wire.""  It's completely insane-- do they think that, in a film with considerable nudity and graphic violence, people are going to be offended by a PMS innuendo?  The whole movie is filled with such intelligence-insulting changes; please do yourself a favor and watch the subtitled version.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This is the most beautiful film i've ever seen. There, i've said it. Watch it and be awed at how amazingly detailed and fluid the whole film is. Never does it falter in the art department. The colours are just right, the peoples movements are so real its scary, and sometimes the strong story of the film cant fit all this beauty in and so it releases it entirely in a magical scene in the middle of the film with no dialogue and no plot progression, just marvellous panoramic followed by marvellous panoramic shot. This is my favourite segment of the movie. It shows the nameless city in which the protagonists exist as a cluttered, enclosed, claustrophobic world, yet terrifyingly familiar. This film is full of such themes which subtly make their way into your mind and you dont even realise they're there until afterwards. So lets talk about the story. Its an amazing monster of a tale, squeezing it all in barely in its short running time. It does sometimes feel a little rushed, a little convoluted so that it bears repeat viewings to get the whole thing, but it is still a strong story none the less. In fact it is a very mature story. The creators could have so easily gone the typical manga route and thrown in some invading demons or mega-destructive internet monsters. But no, the whole thing restrains intself to a realistic view of an extra-ordinary situation. it all feels like this is exactly how it would happen in real life, and that is what makes it so engaging, and so scary. This film deserves to be seen, not just because the heavenly beauty warrants it, but because the deep issues it raises needs to be questioned. If you want to be entertained without thinking, watch Wicked City or the countless millions of other mediocre mangas out there. You want to be entertained and be made to think and question the film? See this. You wont regret it.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Wonderfully executed anime classic. It is a darker anime tale aimed towards a more mature audience.  I enjoyed the amazing realism of this film.  The attention to detail is definitely enjoyable to see. The DVD has a rather enjoyable documentary on the making of the film.  Any fan will enjoy the structure and content of the documentary.  It is quite informative on the process of making the film. Like most Anime, there is a lot of character development and dialogue mixed with stunning visuals. I think the most captivating element that this film has to offer is its creative ""cinematography"" and attention to detail.  There are numerous memorable shots in this film. This is not an anime for everybody.  Attention to story is critical and I am guilty of rewinding certain areas just to keep up with the story. Thankfully this is not a mindless science-fiction/anime tale filled with crazy action sequences.  The Ghost in the Shell proves to be quite philosophical in nature by questioning the meaning of life. I would love to venture deeper into this story and its message but I think it is better for you interpret it on your own. Remember to watch this movie with your heart, not with your mind.  Reflect on it later.  This is the best way to enjoy this type of film.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"There is no doubt that Ghost in the Shell is an anime classic. However does Ghost in the Shell still hold up in the distance future of 2021? Well, I guess it depends.

The entire film a is great example of the Cyberpunk aesthetic, and watching it today you can clearly see its influence on many later directors. My only criticism of the visual design is that it definitely reflects a male gaze in a way that does not seem self aware. Compared with the design however, the animation leaves something to be desired. There are drawn out still shots that linger for quite a long time and long sequences where only a character's mouth moves. This of course is not uncommon in older anime, but it feels cheap even by 90s anime standards. Thankfully you'll usually be busy enough looking at the amazing background art and other design that you can overlook this. For me, the larger disappointment was that the plot and characters are rather basic. The film touches on a number of interesting philosophical topics, such as the nature of consciousness and what it means to be human, without exploring them in any depth or offering any real insights. I find that even bad cyberpunk films, such as 1995's Strange Days, to be much more intellectually interesting. I was also disappointed by how underdeveloped the characters are. Major Motoko has pretty much one line where she talks about herself and doubting her identity. Her partner is basically just the muscle. This underdevelopment makes it difficult to care about them or what's going on in the film. Even the ending feels very low stakes. All told, Ghost In the Shell is undoubtably an anime classic. Visually it more than holds up today, although adult viewers may find it disappointingly shallow in terms of exploring larger concepts and developing characters. Compared to other anime work from the mid 90s, such as ""Memories"" or many other OVAs, I don't think Ghost In the Shell is quite as revolutionary as some make it out to be, although I do love its cyberpunk aesthetic and do appreciate how influential it was. Part of the problem with watching Ghost in the Shell today is that anime has evolved a lot since 1995. While this film once passed as a groundbreaking work for adults, today I can't help but feel it is not an entirely mature work. All of which is to say that while Ghost In the Shell isn't a bad film by any stretch, in my opinion it's been somewhat eclipsed by the universe of anime it and its ilk helped spawn.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I liked everything about this film.  Much has been made of the artwork, and with good reason.  Voltron, this isn't.  I am not an anime fan and haven't seen a lot of anime films.  Most plot descriptions of anime films sound boring to me.  I'm not into monsters and tentacles or cute wide eyed little girls fighting evil.  (Not that cute wide eyed little girls shouldn't fight evil, I mean, I'm all about fighting evil, aren't we all?)  Ghost in the Shell, on the other hand, represents the best of its genre and the best of any genre is worth a watch.  This movie ought to appeal to anyone who enjoys cerebral films.  It addresses interesting philosophical questions about identity, some of which we will no doubt be pondering in the not too distant future.  (I'm perhaps foolishly optimistic when it comes to AI). I should add as well that this is definitively in the cyberpunk genre.  If you liked the old Max Headroom television series or movies like Wargames, this will no doubt appeal to you.  Even the English dubbing isn't bad, even if it is a little bit fast (to keep up with Japanese). Darken the room, sink low in your chair, turn the volume up (the soundtrack is spectacular), and fall into this movie.  I wish there were more like it. The artwork is incredible (if you don't consider animation art, you should take a look at Ghost) and the plot and dialogue are three dimensional and thought provoking.  Two thumbs up.  As I say, best of genre.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Ghost has some of the best animation I've ever seen, and the character designs really fit the story better than the usual big-eyed beautiful girls that typically are found in anime (Akira excepted).  Unlike most animation, the scenes where computer animation is blended with cel look right (was anyone really impressed with the magic carpet ride in Aladdin?). Also, it is very thought provoking and philosophical, even quoting from the bible (the ""through a glass, darkly"" bit, also used in a film by Ingmar Bergman).  However, it doesn't have much emotional punch unless you're one of those people who thought The Matrix wasn't just possible but likely. Even liberals are far too conservative and unwilling for change to feel comfortable with having whole parts of their body replaced to become superhuman (there are already a lot of paranoid people at my college worried about how the government will use the human genome project to control their lives or clone them, despite the fact that there won't be any major advancements for many years).  The views of individuality are a bit strange, too.  Basically, the movie says that we are who we are because of the information stored in our minds, but gives no creedence to the individual ways people process that information (look at autistics).  Think of it this way: a robot can have all the information a human can, but when given a choice between equally good things (such as which kind of ice cream to have or which of the seven urinals to use in an empty bathroom), it would prove itself incapable of this simple human trait.  Sure, the movie understands that (a ""ghost"" in this movie is a soul-like entity), but it doesn't really ""show"" this--the human and partially-human characters feel as unemotional as the computers around them.  Still, that's traditional in science fiction--in the Blade Runner director's cut, the replicants (especially Roy Batty) seem more human than Harrison Ford's character. 7/10 for the subtitled version. The dubbed version is another story.  This is absolutely the worst high-budget dub there is--practically on par with the Skuld episodes from Oh My Goddess (""We've--got--to--help--Belldandy!"" with very hard and pronounced iambs).  On top of that, the sound is so flatly recorded and mixed that you can't understand what's thought and what's spoken (which is very important in this movie).  1/10.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"That anime could be this good. I'd thought I'd seen good anime when a friend brought me 'Akira', but this one is just awesome. It has everything that one could want. An interesting plot, deep thoughts, nice dialog, hot chicks, cool action, neat tech, and animation that puts everything to shame which has ever been produced in the western world. Now when I watch anime I usually expect (and dread) the scene which will explain something about the fundamental nature of life, the universe, or whatever. This is (the only part) where 'Akira' failed. This is where 'Final Fantasy' went down the drain. But 'Ghost in the Shell' shines here brightly. While watching it for the first time I had always this nagging feeling that some such scene would turn up and ruin the truly stunning visuals. Not so. After the '2501' monologue the story really comes together and you start to be eager for story development instead of just looking for the many details and extravagant action sequences. A word on the story: No, you will probably not 'get' the story the first time around. Especially in the English version you will have to make the connection between MoFA, MF, MFA and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that is easy to get confused over. The whole storyline might not be quite as complicated as understanding some 'Aeon Fluxx' episodes, but you have to rewatch the story to get a feel for the interconnection of the different players - especially if you are not familiar with the Ghost in the Shell literature. The story,thank god, is not dumbed down for the average viewer. This is what makes rewatching it so enjoyable. It has also some nice reflections on what it means to be human - things you may ask of yourself after the movie finishes ('Who knows what's inside our heads. Have you ever seen your own brain?'). The animation is superb, and used to unusual effect. The details are exquisite - especially cloth effects and character motions. There are a few scenes that only have music or an accentuating sound effect in the background while the animators show off their full artistic talent. But it's not just show-off time, the visuals are tied in with the subject and leave the viewer time to reflect on the philosophical/sociological messages (like showing the cybernetic heroine look at tailors' dummies) In short: This is a must see for anybody who likes anime. Definitely a movie for grown-ups, though, because the graphic violence may disturb kids and the philosophy will go right over their heads. 10/10",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This movie has only one strong side: the very idea of virtual entity dwelling in a network, moreover revolutionary because the movie was made in 1995 when the Internet had only started to evolve. The rest is simply a boring gunpacked action with futile attempts to create a kind of ""bladerunnerish"" atmosphere, futile attempts to develop a kind of cyberphilosophy and as result no character attracts our sympathy as well as any other emotion at all. Still we must thank this anime for inspiring Gabrielle Salvatores to create his truly atmospheric masterpiece ""Nirvana"" which borrows a lot of cyberworld details from the ""Ghost in the Shell"". I must confess that I tried very hard to catch a cyberpunkish vibe in the ""meditative"" parts of the ""Ghost"" but it was barely possible, too much action around these sections totally swiped the sprout of atmosphere away. In Nirvana I got it from the first frames. Conclude: mediocre script with a great core, mediocre direction, tasteless beefy characters, tons of unnecessary nudity, nice visuals and amazing soundtrack. 6 of 10.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Ghost in the Shell seems to be as lucky as Blade Runner and Akira, blindsiding its audience with novelty and a false sense of depth. Its one of those films where people love to talk what its ""about"", but have little to say on how it portrays its themes. They say its ""about"" conscious, identity, and our dim future...but why should we care? For me, a film must have strong characters to anchor you to the story. They must be realistic and relateable, so you can understand and emphasize with their experiences. But to call GitS's characters two-dimensional is stretching the definition. The story is so focused on the case, we rarely spend any time with the cast, and thus I couldn't care about their interactions or fate. The main character is especially uninteresting: when she supposedly undergoes a great change at the end of the film, she's just as wooden as before. The sacrifice of character isn't even worth the sci-fi, cyber mystery thrills. The plot is so bloated with techno-babel its almost incomprehensible. This isn't depth that requires multiple viewings to understand - this is just bad writing. With little emotion attached to the scenes, I barely maintained attention. Only a few action scenes are scattered through the film, and none are worth the wait. I will concede the animation is pretty good, especially the backgrounds. They're cartoons, but dark, detailed, and realistic. You get a decent sense of this advanced, yet dismal world. If only this quality were in a better film! Its easy to deride those against this film as people who ""just don't get it"". I'd say there's nothing important to take away. Its world is barely explored outside of the premise, and the lone conflict between the main character and villain is so bizarre it has no bearing to reality. Imagination and presentation does not equal depth. Ghost in the Shell felt like it needed another 30 minutes to explain things and develop its themes and characters. Its easily one of the worst films I have watched in terms of writing, but at least it looks good, and is a short burn. With the large amount of sci-fi we have access to these days, I wouldn't recommend GitS to anyone.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This is an incredible work in the science fiction category, but an absolute masterpiece in terms of animated film. Deep thematic probing and philosophical questions dot the story. Characters that are cyborg-humans question their existence... this is a true potential problem for the far future. Is something created outside of a womb without a soul? Do souls even exist? Set all this against some incredible action sequences, plenty of eye candy, and a very dark, acrid backdrop of the future of civilization. This is a summer blockbuster and more. It's ashame that most people are too close-minded to consider a film like this. Bad guys and good guys? No clue. I had to watch the film 3 times to -Understand the plot fully -Understand the motivations of the characters -Realize the depth of the film -And still I'm left with questions If you open your mind, Ghost in the Shell settle itself within you... it will linger far after your first viewing. You will realize that a movie can have action, incredible effects, and STILL be deep. Drama, mystique, philosophy, intrigue, ""going out on a limb"" quality, action, adventure, deep characters who don't fall into bad or good categories, beautiful imagery, mind-boggling plot... even some comedy!

The plot is excellent, though I did not get it the first time. The quality of the graphics surpasses any anime available on the market and the soundtrack is beautiful. The creative team did an amazing job providing the movie with fine details, harmony in this very descriptive world of high technology (AI) and traditional Japan.

IMDb,False,"I was a huge anime fan in highschool but as time progressed, my interests and focus in media have changed.  A few days ago I re-discovered my forgotten anime collection.  Behold, Ghost in the Shell. Watching this fine piece of animation again brought back the reasons why I was attracted to anime in the first place.  It is obvious that a lot of work went into Ghost in the Shell; the attention to graphic details creates some remarkably realistic animation. Though the major reason to see this film is for the animation, there are also other fine points to consider.  It has a fairly complex plot.  The science it focuses on is definitely modern though, albeit, fantastic. I recommend the subtitled version because the dubbed dialog is sometimes over wordy and odd-sounding (as are most dubbed versions). Some viewers may be turned-off by the many scenes that aren't accompanied by music, especially the action sequences.  The music, however, is outstanding. There are a couple of scenes that are basically slide shows of various themes.  These are accompanied with music and no dialog.  The animation, to say the least, is beautiful and seems to be the focus. In summary, Ghost in the Shell is very satisfying.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Ghost in the Shell tells the story of Major Kusanagi, a member of Sector 9, a private defense organization of the Japanese government to investigate cybercrime. Most of all members of sector 9 have altered their bodies, and have cybernetic augments. Our protagonist has only his physical human brain, the rest of his body is synthetic, what could be considered an android. Other comrades like Batou have cybernetic eyes, with multiple uses, while almost everyone has intracranial radio implants to be able to speak without using a microphone. The post-Third World War society that presents us with the world of Ghost in the Shell, combined with the use of this cybernetic improvement technology of the body for all of society, generates a new vision of humanity. These improvements range from simple implants, entire limbs or improvements to productivity. As for example extendable and quick fingers for the secretariat or stronger arms for weight jobs. These improvements generate the concept that human consciousness is ""bottled"" and refers to it as the ""ghost"", the spectrum. The story itself narrates the investigation of a cyber pirate, called the puppeteer, who is wreaking havoc on section 9 and the government, assaulting the bodies and memories of the people. Without going too far into the spoilers, Major Kusanagi, in her quest to know who she is, develops an intellectual fascination for him. This is the starting point for the reflections that the film proposes later, especially those focused on what defines humanity. Where the barrier between the synthetic, the virtual and the real diffuses. Everything that makes you be you may not be yours. Kusanagi spends the whole film wondering who she is and, in the end, reborn between angel feathers and symbols of resurrection. We find nihilistic metaphors in the motif of the reflections, where Kusanagi tries to glimpse what the real world is and who she is. The film's own presentation is replete with these symbols. Kusanagi emerging from the water and merging with his reflection. This symbology reflects our inability to perceive what is real. Oshii gets the viewer to interpret the abstract as a possible world that appears as real to our eyes, the world we inhabit. As the puppet master explains to Kusanagi that only she can see him through a crystal, but with his fusion She will be able to see clearly. The crystal and the water, the reflections, are poetic expressions of the idea ""we can not know what is real"". They are visual symbols of the epistemological nihilism that appears continuously throughout the film... Ghost in the Shell has left an indelible mark on our cultural history, planting the seed of many ideas in different creators. Perhaps the most important and well-known is Lana and Lilly Wachowski's Matrix, the number lines in green when entering the system, the puppet master can be compared with Agent Smith, with his existentialist reflections, aesthetics and especially the fact of that our minds can be part of a world made entirely of data and consequently stop feeling the ""reality"" that we supposedly perceive. It is truly a feature film that is a visual marvel, but the best way to enter into symbiosis with Ghost in the Shell is to watch the film and be predisposed to our mind merging with the delightful images and transport us to another reality. 10/10.",Ghost in the Shell,1995,Eastern
IMDb,False,"GITS is a storm of ironies.  First, the plot criticizes the very advanced computer technology used to create the film.  Its mature themes (nudity and violence) all have relevance, yet draw hordes of immature viewers who end up disappointed by a deeply thoughtful social critique.  And as high-tech as it is, the science it probably explores most deeply is anthropology. Cinematically, it's a masterpiece.  The alliance of Kawai's music (Blue Seed), Kawamori's mechs (Macross Plus), and Oshii's directing meld to create stunningly beautiful work transcending their ""Patlabor"" movies.  Its quality and detail make Disney's best look like laughably tasteless scribbles, even though GITS cost a scant $4 million. Oshii's political themes and ""still life"" sequences are trademark, but to those with no stomach for his tastes, I argue his creative license is a fair compromise for compiling a LONG-running manga into a gripping, self-contained movie.  ""Akira"" is a lot less successful in this aspect. Watch this movie subtitled.  The emotion-starved melancholy Tanaka tastefully infuses in Motoko's voice cannot be replaced with a third-rate American voice actress.

It makes you question your own existence while wondering if humanity is responsible for creating new life with the advent of computerisation.  I have watched this film several times and I am still stunned after each viewing.  Throw in a very complex plot in a very short time frame (80 min) and you have a wonderful film.

On a story level, when you compare this to ""Blade Runner"" and ""Akira"" (it's a common comparison), ""Ghost""'s story is a bit clumsy. Not hard to follow, mind you, but it lacks the impact and whacked-out thrill of the others. For me, at least.

I hope for a realistic version with Artificial Intelligence when the technology is perfected, a fan makes the fan film and uploads it to YouTube, it would be better than the Scarlet Johansson version.

Pretentious dialogues especially from Mokoto Kusanagi, who has a nice drawn butt, Scarlet Johansson is full of operations like rhinoplasty and I guess implantes too, maybe liposuction so she didn't look like Kusanagi.

Great scenes like Kusanagi's first mission of kill and her escape with the camouflage from the Yautja Predator. Also the chase by the pirate.

Good designs of vehicles, weapons, costumes, the infrastructure of the city like the skyscrapers. 

Ghost In The Shell (1995) is better than Blade Runner which has aged badly its technology designs look silly like the stuff from sci fi movies from the 50s.

The music with the choirs screaming in Japanese is a bit annoying so I have to turn down the volume.

IMDb,False,"Over the last decade, Chinese cinema has made giant leaps and bounds in terms of quality and sophistication of their films, especially in sci-fi genre. The Wandering Earth and this prequel, The Wandering Earth II, is a significant milestone. As a prequel, it has more depth in the story than the first, though the premise behind the main conflict is a bit shallow to be believed, as if ""digital life"" and survival of the planet are mutually exclusive. Pizza OR pepperoni? What kind of a decision is that? You still need the pizza, with or without the pepperoni. But like its predecessor, the problem is pacing. The story is grand, an epic tale of an audacious plan to save mankind and Earth from the dying sun. But the pacing is so ridiculously fast, that it's difficult to enjoy and appreciate it. It's so focused on the crisis from all angles that it feels like every scene and every shot is less than two seconds long. For subtitle readers, it's even worse to follow. On top of that, there is visual information overload, with names flashing on the screen. There is so much going on, you will be afraid to blink and miss an important plot point. And then there are the annoying tropes. I think this is the third or fourth Chinese film and TV show I've recently watched that has a shrill little girl/daughter yelling and crying ""Baba! Baba!"" to stoke our sympathy and emotional attachment to. And, where do they find these foreign actors?!? They cannot act and they are loud. Perhaps this is how they want to portray westerners, but there are plenty of international films shown in China--they have to know how bad these actors are, right? With so many actors (waiters) in Hollywood looking for work, you'd think it'd be easy to find more passable supporting cast. Despite all this, you're not going to watch The Wandering Earth series for the acting--this is a CGI spectacle. It's gorgeous, and if you treat it like cut scenes from a triple-A video game, you'll enjoy it a lot.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Earth 2 has no ridiculous young man to do stupid things like in Earth 1, characters do the best to solve problems. Performers did their best in characterizing, and the story makes the Wandering Earth Project more reasonable. But personally, it has some cons: 1. Obvious post dubbing. Many characters talk in different mouth shapes, especially the black boy like he was talkin English but pronounced the others. These scenes quite disturb the watching. 2. The data and the effects of Earth Engines seems not right. It's not spoilers but if you started Earth suddenly you should have massive earthquakes, huge tsunamis and weather disasters... Oh I'm going to spoil so I have to shut now. Hope you've watched Earth1. 3. You got VR tec android but you ummmm why don't you guys create more operating bots? Oop I didn't spoil I'm talking about the trailers. Still, I will give 7.5/10 for this movie. Hope they can fix cons and do well in the next. This gonna be a great series.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"If you are a fan of science fiction films, action blockbuster films, or both, then this movie is for you. This movie takes the usual Hollywood sci-fi movie tropes and puts a unique Chinese spin on them. Without getting into details, it's about a group of scientists and astronauts trying to save the world from imminent destruction while governments disagree on the best course of action. The movie takes us on a wild ride as teams of unlikely heroes face moral dilemmas and make sacrifices to secure the future of mankind. At its core, the film delivers a hopeful message about the power of humanity when we work together to solve problems - a message that is sorely needed in the current times. Pros: Jaw-dropping action sequences, slick CGI and some thought-provoking technological and philosophical concepts that will make you think about where humanity is headed in the future. Themes such as AI and automation, our increasing dependence on technology, the meaning of human existence and mortality, and the future of civilization, provide plenty of food for thought. There is also a major plot twist in the third act that you will not see coming, so stay tuned till the end, especially during the credits (there's an Easter egg scene that hints at a possible third installment to this franchise). Cons: The movie is bit lengthy, at nearly 3 hours, so make sure you avoid drinking a lot of fluids before or during the movie. (Apparently the director already cut 80 minutes out of the movie, so it really was the equivalent of two movies packed into one.) Also, because the movie is multilingual, some languages are dubbed weirdly in some scenes, but it's easy to overlook this because you'll be too busy marvelling at the visuals or trying to keep up with all the action sequences. Conclusion: If you are a fan of sci-fi action blockbusters then this movie is for you. Definitely do not miss it in cinemas - this is a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This is a massive movie that has many many absolutely amazing scenes. I was really blown away, but after an hour I was finding it to be a bit too much intensity and it was becoming a bit exhausting. Still very impressive. I found I was not interested in the human drama built into the story. I don't know why the dubbed English parts were so odd. There is a lot of dialogue you have to read subtitles for that is going quickly but there is so much action you end up missing something no matter where you look.

At the same time, as the second of the series, it did not regress like most movies, but made obvious progress,. The overall score is 9 points, looking forward to the third part to bring us a better story. There are three lines in the movie which build a wonderful construction. I promise it deserves one ticket.

Thoroughly recommended 👌 Roll on TWE3.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The Wandering Earth II tells a disaster story from an oriental point of view instead of the western one (which is getting more and more cliche), where humans work as a team to face the overwhelming crisis. There's no hero who can save the Earth single-handedly; still, every effort matters. In many ways, TWE II is a true sight for the sore eyes in nowadays movie industry, even by the criteria of Hollywood. Outstanding visuals & acoustics, compelling narrative, numerous convincing concepts and details, and furthermore, a much more ""universal"" human value. It raises the ceiling for movies of the same genre to a whole new level. If you let go of all the stereotypical thinking and preconceived bias against Chinese movies, then TWE II is definitely worth seeing (better in IMAX).

IMDb,False,"Good things about the movie: special effects were really cool, I love Andy Lau's performance, I believe it's a type of role he has rarely attempted. Spectacular movie. Now moving on to the bad: parts of the plot were not closed and left one scratching their head - what was the point of that? Is this thing evil or not? For a movie of such high production quality, I really expected the plot to be tighter. The movie could be shorter. The UN parts were long and didn't add much to the movie for the most part except for one speech. Overall, similar issues as the first movie. Even disregarding the nationalistic tone, plot logic has been sacrificed for grandiose scenes and lines.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"With its epic scope and impressive production values, The Wandering Earth 2 ambitiously world-builds on its predecessor, delivering Hollywood-level special effects, action-packed spectacle, and dual storylines featuring Wu Jing and Andy Lau. Unfortunately, the film is dampened by sequelitis and predominantly focused on outdoing the previous film's production values. Director Frant Gwo throws everything on screen to the point of sensory overload. It is still fun popcorn entertainment; fans of the original will appreciate the expanded mythos, but with no breathing room, it buckles under the weight of its ambitions. The story is a prequel to 2019's The Wandering Earth. The Sun's gradual expansion into a red giant threatens to engulf Earth in 100 years. Countries submit plans of action, including the Digital Life Project, which proposes the digitized preservation of human consciousness, and, the Moving Mountain project, which proposes installing thousands of ion engines to propel the Earth into a new solar system. The United Earth Government chooses the Moving Mountain project, spurring terrorist attacks from Digital Life supporters. UEG astronaut Liu Peiqiang and his team race against time to restore the world's faith in the Moving Mountain project. The mission is threatened by Digital Life engineer Tu Hengyu, who seeks to prolong his dead daughter Yaya's digital consciousness after losing her in a car accident. The construction of the Moving Mountain engines is interrupted when Tu uploads his daughter's consciousness into the network. First off, as seen above, there's too much plot. The story covers an entire TV season's worth and the plot strands are so tightly interwoven, that cutting one thing out would mean cutting out an entire story arc. The fast editing with blink-and-you-miss-it subtitles weakens the dramatic impact of what's happening as the film never gives time for the drama to properly breathe. This could have easily been two movies. Wu Jing is a charismatic leading man and with every new movie, is getting better at manipulating his star power and fitting himself in whatever scene he's in. Andy Lau gets to flex his acting muscles playing against type as the film's antagonist Tu, but distinctly not a villain. Lau plays out the humanity of the situation and keeps his character sympathetic. The two stars share one scene together and it left a lot to be desired in terms of having human moments. I was hoping for a Blade Runner-esque philosophical debate between the two leads, one arguing for human life and the other for digital consciousness. As someone who was sad for two weeks when he passed away, it was fulfilling to see the CGI Ng Man Tat cameo. It struck me still seeing Uncle Tat, as short as it lasted. The film was so overwhelming that I tired out during the 3rd act. Everything just blurred together into one vague memory. It was just a lot of stuff happening and I honestly forgot a lot of it when I walked out. I am invested in the Wandering Earth world and would happily watch a third installment. However, the filmmakers don't need to do everything bigger. Everything is big enough.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"There is no question this movie had a big enough budget to allow for top notch CGI effects. And when that happens, it holds its own against the best companies out there. So for those liking blockbuster special effects, this is a movie to see. The background is that the sun is expanding, and there are two approaches to saving humans. One is a Digital Life project, where the person's memories are put into a computer, and with quantum computers, it can make it seem as if the person is still alive. The second is a massive engine project, where massive engines on both the earth and the moon are in tandem, and both are moved out of orbit to another location in the solar system. The engine approach is the one in favor, but there is opposition, and the computers get hacked, leading to a rousing CGI battle. One doesn't watch movies like this to assess how real the solutions might be, just is it entertaining. A problem I have with the movie is that crisis after crisis gets thrown to the audience, and each solution became even more far out. It becomes overload. Being that it is a very long movie, there are entire sub-stories that could be left out without ruining the intent of the story. And it seems standard in Chinese movies that at some point, a Chinese person plays a super human role that no mere mortal could go, and that becomes key. I will leave it to the viewers if that happens in this movie, since there are so many moving parts. And while I understand the role the child Yaya plays, she became irritating with her voice quickly.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"While many of the reviews for this thing are likely paid posts - but then so are many for Disney and Marvel - this is interesting to watch for non-Chinese viewers to assess the Chinese mindset in the middle of the biggest political crisis since WWII. With all the noise about Taiwan, do the Chinese use mega-productions like these to rouse anti-foreign sentiment like the Americans do (and they themselves did with ""Wolf Warrior 2""? Well, turns out this is not the case and China seems committed to a we-have-to-work-together-or-else ideology which is fairly appropriate given the many, many problems the world is facing right now. The very convoluted story is almost impossible to break down for this three-hour action piece in which something explodes every five minutes, but the basics are that a Chinese-led, yet internationally financed and coordinated team of scientists builds a net of mega thrusters to propel Earth out of the solar orbit before the sun flares up. There's a lunar station to test those thrusters reached by some kind of mega elevator which is attacked by terrorists (suspiciously similar to Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation""). First of many major script flaws: who are they? What is their motivation? Who backs them? The film makers can't be bothered to explain. At this point you have to switch off your brain to enjoy the movie, otherwise it becomes sheer torture because nothing makes sense. Andy Lau's scientist is obsessed with uploading his dead daughter's collected memory into a new form of AI - does this cause the malfunction on the Moon which then puts it on collision course with Earth? No answer. But hey, did ""Avatar The Way of the Water"" make any sense? Not really, but it had perhaps a tad more character development. After two hours, you continue asking yourself ""who are these people""? If you are neutral on the US-China conflict, this is an enjoyable albeit completely bonkers disaster flick which may give you a little hope that the Chinese are not quite as belligerent as the US would have make us believe. If you find glaring plot holes and complete lack of coherency insufferable, better watch something else.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Once the best science fiction film in my mind was Interstellar , but this film from China opened a new world for me. Its thinking about the future of mankind is completely different from the personal heroism of Hollywood. I didn't think that collectivism was so magnificent. I think we should seriously consider this issue. The film also discusses the relationship between AI and people. The plot is very deep, the picture is beautiful, and the sound effect is also great. I think Hollywood needs to make changes. I'm tired of the old plot. This film is the best science fiction film in recent years, just like Interstellar . Interstellar is the latest bestest film of science fiction films that any science fiction fan can't ignore. It perfectly shows the awesome romance of the universe. Cooper is in a different gravitational environment, and the time passed on him is different from the earth. In a moment, there are countless days and nights in the remote hometown. In a moment, there is eternity. It really shocked me at that time. But there are two problems. Cooper can say that his responsibility is to look for light, and Brand can say that he is carrying despair. What despair? Because mankind has given up, the world is desperate, the government and the people have given up. This kind of lonely burden on the whole world is really magnificent, but it is really unreal. Just like his ending, the five-dimensional space is too beautiful to be true. And I can understand that love can cross the Milky Way, can it cross time and space? It's fantastic. But The Wandering Earth 2 is different. It is true that every flower, every tree, every person, and every thing are like the future that will happen soon. From the beginning of the vast space elevator project, the automatic takeover of quantum computers, including the details of Liu Peiqiang's multifunctional robot for security inspection,it shocked me deeply. It seems to be the same sense of reality as the recorded video sent 20 years later. In particular, the design of the space elevator, which is propelled by rocket and pulled by magnetic force, is too detailed, too real and too powerful. Moreover, the huge plan to save mankind and the lucky gambling of several people in the Interstellar have been decided! Every step of action has an operational plan in The Wandering Earth II. The feasibility verification of planetary engines, the upgrading and iteration of quantum computers, the training of astronauts, the lunar push-off plan, the lunar collapse plan, and the Internet root server restart plan. All these have steps, plans and implementation; In the process, there are command organizations, technical personnel, and alternative solutions. This is the real hard-core science fiction setting. Saving humanity necessarily requires the unity of the whole humanity. Science fiction, science fiction, theory can be fantasy, engineering should be closer to reality. Otherwise, it would be too much less scientific to imagine. The dream of Interstellar beauty, while The Wandering Earth 2 is thick and real,and still beautiful to the extreme.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This one is better than the first movie, which is very rare these days. The story lines are great. Although there are some plots that do not make a lot sense, it doesn't affect the overall rating at all. It doesn't make me feel it's a 3hr movie at all. This is actually the best Si-Fi movie I have watched in the last 3 years (and I've watched a lot lol) and I think it's fair to say it's better than 70% of the Hollywood Si-Fi movies these days. I'm looking forward to the third one now given there are some flash forward scenes hinting at the next story line. Also, don't miss the credits at the end. I left early and have to read up on the end credit scenes online afterwards.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Definitely better than Moonfall (a traumatizing tragedy) and lives up to the fame of its first counterpart. Inventive cinematography, compelling performances, and jokes that really land. Moreover, sublime visual effects, shown in the futuristic production design, blade-runner-ish architectures, and aesthetic visual layout especially upon the moon, which I can confidently claim amount to Dune's level of impressiveness. Plot-wise, despite the multiple storylines and fragmented expedition, the film does successfully employ suspenseful buildups through countdowns, recurring motivic dialogues, and emotively riveting missions, which all demonstrate the directory's effort and heed to this ardently demanded movie (at least in the mainland). This takes me to my major complaint: I understand the profit-oriented intention behind revising the Wandering Earth into a movie series, but as a fan of the book, the conversion of the original's spinal ideology and the abandonment of its overarching incidents have exceeded my level of tolerance. Why does the production refuse to present the already-there perfectly constructed story in the book, which has all of apocalypse, desolation, hardcore science, dystopia, survivorship, conspiracy, revolution, filial piety, and censored love, and choose to borrow the mere concept. Comparing to the desperately rational and selfish characters in the novel, the film adapts a bunch of romantically heroic idealists, as their martyrdom is emphatically lauded. However, has it really been this way when humanity encounters a global crisis? Do the saints actually unite and salvage us? Or do they (censored material)?",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"That film looks like a tik-tok feed - every 15 seconds nothing happens. Nothing makes sense, but it is colourful. If you try to make some inferences about the overall plot from the random scenes you are about to end up in a very bad place. The thing that is really intrusive is how awfully incompetent are all totalitarian regimes in their propaganda efforts. That film is entirely composed of contradictory, incoherent propaganda symbols, they are not even developed into messages, but are very basic symbols. The CCP committee responsible for the production is strikingly unaware of national stereotypes and it failed miserably in trying to make a caricature or conveying some satirical effect. The positive ratings and generic reviews here are definitely bots.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Don't worry about political propaganda and nationalism. China is not what Westerners now imagine, and Chinese movies are not. If you watch the film with the fear of political propaganda, you will miss a piece of art. In this film, the proportion of Chinese is not very high, and the image of Americans in this film is not what some people think of as ""villains or clowns"". The United States is only in conflict with the protagonists, and the United States has also participated in all actions of human self-rescue. Unlike the heavily biased Hollywood films, no country has been devalued in this film. This film continues the theme of unity and peace in the first film. And this time it has a rich and thought-provoking plot. Please put down racial prejudice, take your mind to watch the whole movie carefully, and don't miss the final colored egg of the movie. All the questions that arise when you watch the film, and all the places that seem to be the director's mistakes, will form an interesting turning point at the end of the film. This transition makes the plot of the whole film more reasonable, and at the same time gives you deeper philosophical thinking. In addition, many details are arranged in the film by the director. If you have watched the first film or have lived in China, they will be very good seasoning. Finally, many websites, especially rotten tomatoes, wrote about the film before January 22, which means they have never seen it. To draw a conclusion on it only by virtue of stereotype, they used lies to deny the painstaking efforts of the film team for four years.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The Chinese Sci-fi blockbuster is absolutely a visual spectacle. The three-hour film featured wild imagination and bold designs that matches, if not surpasses, world-class sci-fi big names. One should be amazed at the level Chinese visual effect industry has reached within such a short time (Chinese sci-fi movies with stunning visuals were extremely rare before 2017). On the other hand, the movie marks a return of a post-pandemic Chinese society which, upon its release on the first day of the year of the Rabbit, rings a particular bell for both all Chinese and the world. It is definitely worth the ticket, yet the story could be refined in many ways because its narrative seemed a bit flawed and empty in my personal view. To start with, this movie is too lengthy for its contents, some jokes and emotional plots may seem unnecessary and redundant. If it were to be around 2 hours, it would look much better. The plot twist entering the second Moon crisis where human were forced to nuke the Moon, seemed confusing and undercooked. I was dumbfounded and puzzled when the character played by Andy Lau made such a bad decision that it caused a huge disaster for the whole planet. To me this plot twist doesn't make sense and surely needs more explanation.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The plot is hoaky and predictable, and wayyy to many cliché scenes they copied from American movies such as 'contact' and 'independence day'. The author of the story did well in 3 body problem trilogy, but his other works are just intolerably boring and facky. Sad he didn't even get the science parts, like solar wind doesn't blow the dust on the moon, and space elevators don't use rockets which defeats the purpose of space elevators (why use cables when rockets can sent space crafts upward without them?). The stories of the two guys, one trying to create digital copy of dead daughter and the other with cancer dying wife, are so overused in Chinese movies they are lame.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I didn't like The Wandering Earth and was not even 1% excited for the second part and that also a prequel. The story was a prequel and was written better than the first part, the screenplay was bad like the original and the runtime was too long, the direction was good and the performances were also good, not great. If I talk about the overall execution then it lacked a good screenplay even after having a vetter story than the original. The runtime and the pacing were also other major issues. Overall, it was a decent prequel which was little bit on better side than the original but don't expect too much from it.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I've heard of a lot of so-called ""high-budget"" Chinese films, and the vast majority of them are unimpressive, but this one is completely different. The special effects are great, with minor flaws, but they don't affect the viewing experience; The narrative has weakened individual heroism, and it is overall more towards a grand narrative. The middle part of the emotional portrayal is rather stiff, so the actual rating is 9/10, but I will give it an extra because Marvel movies these years suck. Overall, this sci-fi movie manages to tell a pretty attractive story with good visual effects, and it comes from China. It's nice to see new competition in the sci-fi movie industry. BTW, some critics think that there are parts of the movie that put too much emphasis on nationalism, which I think is a bit overstated. It seems to be more about some of the plots or statements that people associate with their stereotypes of China, rather than the movie itself emphasizing a political ideology.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The impending annihilation of Earth by an expanding sun triggers two competing projects to save humanity: the Digital Life Project (DLP), in which people are digitised and live on in-silico and 'Wandering Earth', in which a select subset of the population lives in underground cites while colossal rocket engines push Earth to a new orbital home around 'near-by' Alpha Centauri. This is a prequel to 'The Wandering Earth' and despite knowing how it's going to end (i.e. We wander), was to me the superior film. The CGI, design and special effects are outstanding at times and the film has a 'hard-science' realism to off-set the somewhat preposterous premise. Unfortunately, the filmmakers sacrificed facts and physics for spectacular CGI set-pieces ('rocket-powered space-elevators' are a bit of an oxymoran, solar storms don't cause lunar dust storms, and when something is 'cut loose' in orbit, it doesn't 'fall'). These kinds of 'scientific' flaws, along with the usual 'sound in space', objects falling on the moon at 1G acceleration, spaceships that 'bank' when flying in a vacuum etc are sadly typical for the genre and might as well be accepted as 'craft' over 'reality' (looking cool is more box-office friendly than looking real). I quite liked the backstory about the proponents of DLP fighting to maintain a project that could potentially 'save' everyone, not just a chosen few, and the side plot about the AI girl with a 2-minute lifespan was quite clever. The acting and direction is fine (and on par with similar 'western' CGI-epics) but the story is a bit disjointed and the mid-credit revelation seems to come out of nowhere (and seems like a simplistic plot driver rather than an intriguing twist). I am a sucker for epic 'world-building' effects, so liked the film more for its look than its substance. Given the mega-budget dreck Hollywood has been gurgitating, a little competition should be a good thing.",The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern

RottenTomatoes,False,"An absolutely epic sci-fi. There is so much going on in this prequel to the first Wandering Earth. It's one of those times when a prequel surpasses the original, and not because this is some sort of superhero origin story type prequel. This takes the catastrophe that brings about the wandering earth back to its origins, and we get to see how this sort of crisis changes society forever. While the story seems quite simple and even unoriginal for a sci-fi (major earth catastrophe, can no longer sustain life in current conditions, science must come to the rescue) the solution to the problem and the intricacies in solving it, as well as all the failures and close calls along the way, make for a very engrossing action movie. They also weave in some really effective foreshadowing for what you already know is coming in the original movie but it feels foreboding nonetheless.

The special effects are top of the line and the way the story is told through various countdowns, like mini-chapters, keeps engagement high. The AI development and the implicit commentary that comes with is also quite good.

The one major downside to this movie (and it is quite major) is that almost all of the speaking parts that aren't in Chinese are overdubbed in such a ridiculous fashion. They don't seem to employ any sort of dubbing technique... no phrase-syncing, lip-syncing, or even time-syncing. It's just <i>off</i>, and sometimes incredibly so. And some of the voice performances they get in both English and Russian are just the most ridiculous caricatures. It's annoying and distracting and I could see it making the movie unwatchable for some.

Letterboxd,False,《流浪地球》不論在電影製作方面或是思想內容方面都創下了一個新的高度。電影裡中國提出移山計劃應對太陽危機，沒有各國團結一致這個任務不可能完成，任誰都可以察覺得到這是對應在現實中中國提出的人類命運共同體方案，不論是在劉慈欣筆下的科幻世界或是我們身處的現實世界，要讓不同意識形態的國家團結在一起應對人類危機都是件非常困難的事，然後我們就會去想：這方案很理想主義（同時還排除馬恩列等構想的藍圖，好吧，我當是宇宙不再留時間給人類）。不過，不論在虛實世界裡面都讓我們看到的是，如果不走這條路，人類就會走進毁滅，電影中的鬥爭其實就是兩種意識形態的對抗：一種包含集體思維、希望積極團結；一種呈現個人主義、黑暗虛無毁滅。沒有紅色理想的話，不會有前一種意識形態，就不會有各種中國方案。這是一部面對現實同時回應現實的作品。,The Wandering Earth II,2023,Eastern

IMDb,False,"I read through the reviews here before I watched it and didn't know what to expect: a classic or a bummer? In my view, the truth is in the middle and the average vote of currently 5.8 seems justified. ""Natural City"" is by no means a movie on the ""Blade Runner"" level. Take away the futuristic eye-candy, and what is left? A man is in love with a cyborg lady without really telling us why, how or what for. Real character development is not happening! He gets in a conflict with his friend over the cyborgs which leads to gratuitous violence with faces covered in blood like in a million action flicks before. Meanwhile, a girl plants flowers in a roof garden to provide a contrast to the post-war destruction scenery around. ""Natural City"" doesn't really have any new ideas, it simply spices up the collection of familiar trade marks with ""Matrix/Equilibrium Next Generation"" visuals which is fine for web 2.0 designers but not for the art of film making. Everybody who truly believes this is going to be a classic should go watch ""Soylent Green"" where it was the actors and the story that mattered. Still, ""Natural City"" is a movie that has its touching or stunning moments. Actually, I liked that explanations were not provided in many cases. One might argue whether it is a deliberate attempt to open it for interpretation or simply plot holes. But I think, if we once really caught a glimpse of the year 2080, there would be much that we won't comprehend, either. You know how silly SF movies of the 1950s seem today because they applied manners, moral standards and ways of conversation that are outdated. In this respect, I'm curious what people will think of ""Natural City"" in the future. Keep it in the archive.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Natural city While Natural city gets often compared to blade runner, I think it is a comparison is not quite fair to Blade runner. Don't get me wrong I don't think NC is a bad movie, but it is not the ultra paranoid Phillip K dick style future noir. The film looks great and shows a dirty, unhappy view of korea's future like Blade runner. I admit I got a little lost and bored at times but the film has great visuals and for the most part the story is a interesting take on cyborgs robots and the like.  The gun battles and the various martial arts action scenes were well done(except for a minor overuse of Slo-Mo). Worth a rental. If you're a Sci-FI addict it should be on your list.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I saw a screening of this film recently at the Milan Fair and I'm inclined to say that, while it was rather interesting, I would not suggest it to anyone but hardcore fans of SF. In a way the concept is reminiscent of Bladerunner: The (male) officer of law falling for the (female) cyborg/clone/android that has an 'expiration date', while on the other hand, he is fighting the rebellious cyborgs/clones/androids. There are a number of twists in the plot that add interest, the photography is very good, the acting is fine and the action scenes are typical Asian. All in all, quite interesting but not fulfilling...",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"..... in fact, a lot better than expected. I watched both trailers before the movie to see if it looked any good, and it did. It looked stunning, just a bit empty. On watching it, i found it to be very accomplished, it put most Hollywood films to shame. In saying that, though, there really aren't any US equivalents to this. Yeah, it borrows from plenty of other movies, but none of them would be so daring or have such a sombre tone. This is quite bleak and nasty stuff. Highly recommended, just don't expect a happy ending or any humour. If great, Blade Runner-style visuals are your thing, you'll find plenty to enjoy. Four out of five.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I rate this movie high on the visuals. Yes its Blade Runner-ish but truth be told it would be very difficult to make any ""cyberpunk"" or movie with cyborgs and humans without it somehow taking elements from BladeRunner. The visuals and CG are very good. The story line is a bit confusing in the beginning. It is also a tad slow and on the longish side. The movie's plot is around a special forces cop who is trying to extend the life of his cyborg girlfriend (cyborgs have expiry dates). He does unscrupulous stuff etc and pays a rogue cyborg manufacturer to extend her life. Of course the mad scientist have an agenda of his own whose disclosure leads to the last sequence of the movie. The action scenes are quite good although dark. The story so-so. but I give points to how good the movie looked. I would recommend this movie if you are into the whole cyberpunk genre and enjoy visuals over deep stories and acting.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I've just watched this movie. Yes,Blade Runner looms large over it. But it's not a clone. Beyond Hollwood takes the movie to task, because the main character is basically a jerk, and the guy who would normally be the hero plays a secondary role. But that's the beauty of Asian movies, they don't conform to the norm. Anyway if this was a gangster movie, there would be nothing wrong in having a bad guy as the lead character. The other part the reviewer took the movie to task over was the relation between R and Ria. Ria showed no emotion. Well she was a cyborg R was indifferent to her. Well, yes, I'm prepared to concede that point. Why did R love Ria. Does everything have to be explained? I just accepted that he did. What I didn't like about the movie was the climatic action scene. Sure it was exciting, and well done. But for me, it was too Hollywood. I expect more from Korean movies. I thought the ending was beautiful though.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Natural City is one of several recent Korean movies (such as 2046) from a new school of film-making in Asia. And unfortunately, after watching, digesting, and allowing this film to sink in, I can only reach the inescapable conclusion that this 'new school' consists of former music video directors who have watched Blade Runner far too many times. The discerning film-goer will even notice some exact shots are actually lifted in this movie from Ridley Scott's neo-noir masterpiece. This film - perhaps even more than the source material that it clearly owes its entire existence to - relies far too much on slick, but ultimately hollow and meaningless, cinematography. Its story slows to a crawl, and patches together pointless scenes such as R's bar fight to keep what semblance of kinetic energy it promised on the film's back cover going. Ridiculous logistical scenes are turned into ethereal mini-music videos with no point and no underlying symbolism. It's as if the director is desperately trying to emulate the emotional power of scenes in Blade Runner by using that film's same tricks - slow motion, sappy music, and rain. Unfortunately, Natural City never hits anywhere near the mark it sets for itself, and the director seems genuinely clueless as to what his movie's actual symbolic meaning is. The result is a muddled atrocity of a story that moves like frozen chocolate pudding and has to resort to a big gunfight and cliché 'self-destruct countdown' sequence as its climax to make up for its own glaring shortcomings. The good things about this movie? The lead actor, playing the part of R, is actually quite good at attracting empathy. Visually, there are a few interesting bits. The death of one of the film's main characters is a touching but hollow scene, which perhaps unintentionally works in its favor. Some of the atmosphere is very depressive and moody and really lends to the overall feel, but I don't think any single scene really steps out and defines this film visually. There is a very generic sci-fi feel to certain things (such as the M.P.'s, and the gunfight at the beginning of the film). I should make very clear that while this film is clearly derivative of Blade Runner, it is nowhere near the feast for the eyes that the former is, and it also fails miserably at putting its own unique visual spin on the future. And as a simple aside, to those who suggest that it is unfair to compare the two films - Natural City itself draws the comparisons, actively inciting them on its front cover. That is this movie's gimmick, and ultimately, its failing.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I've always been a fan of science fiction. The theme of cyborgs especially captures my attention, alongside the arguments for and against their incorporation into society, coupled with the philosophical discussion on whether they can potentially acquire human feelings. Natural City, with its beautiful landscape, detailed effects and impressive vision grabbed my attention, however, the aforementioned ideas above appear fleetingly in a film where they are essentially paramount. R (Ji-tae Yu) is a member of the police force of 2080; a team of elite troopers, who keep the fragile peace in a post-apocalyptic society, where humans and cyborgs live awkwardly beside each other. Once a revered officer, R has been forced to commit illegalities in order to keep his beautiful cyborg girlfriend, Ria (Rin Seo) alive, pitifully fighting her short life span, that will inevitably consume her. His actions have turned him against his best friend, and fellow officer, Noma (Chang Yun), who tries desperately to keep R out of trouble. When R is told by the brilliant, but deranged Cyborg specialist, Dr Zero (Jung Eun-Pyo), that Cyon (Jae-un Lee), a beautiful, young working girl, has all the ingredients he needs to keep Ria indefinitely alive, R will stop at nothing to find her. Unfortunately, rogue combat cyborg Cypher (Doo-hong Jung) also requires Cyon to increase his life expectancy, culminating in a violent battle for preservation. As a lead character, R is difficult to sympathize with. Often aggressive and bitter, the only times he is shown to be compassionate, is in the company of Ria, whose screen time is minimal in contrast with the other characters, despite the pivotal part she plays. Characterization in general is sparse across the narrative, with little back-story, most characters having a very narrow agenda. Ria on the other hand, says several key phrases over the course of the feature that have considerable impact, however, their importance is undermined by the focus on the action-oriented story-line. Moments of beautiful tenderness, accentuated by the touching musical score, are equally short-lived, though are more memorable than the fight scenes. These are considerably violent, containing a combination of gun battles and martial arts, and though occasionally impressive, these are also handled by using slow motion and quick shots, that do not always result in appealingly fluid moments. Though Natural City is a film thematically focused around relationships, I couldn't help but notice the distance between the characters, even in scenes when they were barely an inch from each other. Feelings of hopelessness, and the debate on mortality gnaw at you from every angle, until even the sweetest parts of the film seem so utterly depressing. Perhaps I'm a romantic, however, I would have liked a deeper, more passionate focus on R and Ria, which offered a unique perspective to the audience, rather than the clichéd plot concerning killer cyborgs.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Natural City is about some guy who likes to hump a robot. Meanwhile, some militant group is trying to stop cyborg terrorists from doing naughty things. The story was alright but the pacing was like hippopotamus butt loving. The cinematography is somewhat simular to movies like Blade Runner but less colorful. This has more so a sombre look. Also I wish the cyborgs were more cyborgy. The action was probably the best thing about the movie. Full of Matrix like bull$#!+. Not a bad movie but it's only worth watching one or two times.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Now I liked a lot of the film it except for one major thing...the story. I felt at times that the photography, special effects, and even the acting were too good for this absolutely pathetic story. It seemed to drag and drag, and the big plot twists were too little too late and at that point of the story it is truly hard to care. I felt that this could have been an excellent film, because everything else in the film was excellent. It just goes to show that if you don't have a good story and screenplay, nothing can save it. It seemed to just be missing a few major plot points, and even the ones they had were poorly written, and poorly executed. I would really only recommend this to the hardcore sci-fi films, and even then this will be quickly forgotten.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I would put this as one of the most beautiful science fiction films ever made ... As much as this is an homage to Blade Runner it also draws heavily from the Matrix and HK Cop films. Like a great hip hop record or a Tarantino film, it weaves familiar elements together in a way that not only seems fresh but gives you a new appreciation for the original sources. One of the things I loved most about this movie was its look and in particular the way the CGI was integrated almost seamlessly with 'real' live action cinematography. As opposed to many western sci-fi movies, for example the new Star Wars movies or I, Robot where the actors are shot on a green screen and then composted over a completely synthetic background. Natural City might use a shot of a cityscape and then drop in CGI elements like a craft flying over. They employ another technique which was used a lot in 70's scifi films like Logan's Run - inter cutting SFX scenes with live action that was just shot on real, futuristic-looking locations. This really balances out the artificiality of the effects and shows that a little can go a long way ... The result is an extremely realistic look and feel to the movie. I believe that this is what the world could look like in 2080. Natural City's only real flaw, in my eyes, is that it does tend to get slow in a few key spots. But every shot in this film is so gorgeous it's hard to know where they would cut. All in all I really enjoyed this film and would highly recommend it.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I'm not going to say this movie makes the least sense of every movie I've ever seen, because I've seen an awful lot of movies, but it's got to at least be one of the most senseless. This movie starts quite well with a puzzling but intriguing intro that sets up the film's excellent visual style. In fact, there are a number of really cool moments scattered through the movie. Unfortunately, Natural City turns out to be a remarkable example of what happens with a writer who can't put together a coherent story proves to also be a director who is unable to tell a story clearly. Nothing in this movie makes much sense. I don't just mean the story. Once it's all over I can say I at least understand what happened and for the most part why. But character motivations and reactions are inexplicable, the science is ludicrous and the futuristic vision is muddled. This is a movie where a kidnapping is treated like a case of bad manners and the protagonists outrageous behavior causes barely a ripple. The lead character is unlikeable and outside of Cyon (played very nicely by Jae-un Lee) and some old lady named Bonggong or some such thing, the rest of the cast is underwhelming. The cyborg love interest seems to have the personality of a cocker spaniel, making it difficult to have much feeling for her, and in fact all attempts to wring an emotional reaction from the material fail abysmally. The movie makes more sense in the last third, becoming a relatively straightforward action picture, but by then you're trapped in a movie with characters you don't care about making everything that happens feel trivial. The movie is slick and glossy with some nice special effects, which is what kept me from turning it off (that and the hope that somehow it would all come together eventually), but it's just dreadful film making that gets more and more painful as it goes along.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Did you know that George Lucas was inspired to make ""Star Wars"" from a Japanese film called ""Hidden Fortress""? Bet some of the reviewers here didn't. Why get all bent out of shape when the person who made ""Blade Runner"" did the same thing. Every film maker is inspired by someone else's work. OK, the action and visuals are nice. The characters are very mechanical and they don't go deep into them so the movie seemed more focused on action and CGI. There were some slow spots between the action and the characters really didn't pull me in much. Yes, there is plenty of borrowing from Blade Runner but it didn't bother me much. Hollywood borrows plenty as well. I don't get upset about it. Without sampling there would be no Hip-Hop or Star Wars. If you like action, sci-fi, and CGI and don't need a lot of character development, give it a go.",Natural City,2003,Eastern
IMDb,False,"First off this is an excellent movie - way ahead of American Sci-Fi for heart and brain. It is a bit tedious to watch with subtitles but this is probably an advantage over a poor dub. Visually this movie is extremely derivative of Blade Runner but that doesn't detract from it's own brilliance. I love the fact that the line between good and evil is blurred and in that sense it is more true to life than most soulless western sci-fi pics. Be prepared for the love story - an element that many action viewers won't have patience for but this is a hallmark of the Asian film engine. Biggest drawback of the movie is the music score; which may be a factor of the culture of origin. It could have used a little techno to spice up the action (which is filmed beautifully by the way). If you are a REAL sci-fi fan, appreciate art in your cinematography, and consider watching a foreign language film you won't regret seeing this.

IMDb,False,"A movie with cyborgs, artificial intelligence, flying cars, and virtual reality simulations, sounds like it should turn out great doesn't it?

I tried to find good qualities about the main character, a military policeman named R, I tried to find a reason to care about this character but couldn't find any.

IMDb,False,"When the movie was over, I did end of liking it. But before that, it was really hard to get into. The story jumps around a lot and is missing many pieces. But by the end, it does come all together. The film is Sci-Fi, but really just ends up being a love story in a way. All about a man and what he will do to keep his love for a cyborg. Ji-tae Yu is the main character and he is in love with a robot played by Rin Seo. Rin Seo was a little off on her acting skills, but I did enjoy Ji-tae Yu's performance. Jae-un Lee plays the other big part and she is decent. Now the movie has a couple fight scenes and they were pretty intense. They were all in bullet time slow motion and it really gave a stronger feel to them. The only problem was that you wanted more, and there just wasn't enough. There is a great fight scene between Ji-tae Yu and Doo-hong Jung though. It was not that long and I really wanted to be. But it was still great to watch.

IMDb,False,"Just watched NATURAL CITY, which I wasn't expecting to enjoy too much after most of the other Korean sci-fi ""blockbuster"" films of the past few years, but I do think this one is the pick of the litter. It's an interesting and perhaps slightly muddled film, that mixes sci-fi spectacle and fantastic action scenes with a much more subtle and introspective side that's really the core of the film and probably befuddled the audience a lot. The cyborgs and mad scientists aren't really what the film is about, it's about the loneliness and detachment of the characters in a world where personal relationships have deteriorated even further than in our own. The fact that the acting is ""wooden"" is arguably deliberate, as the characters have no real emotional lives.

Too much sci-fi has become pretty people in black PVC or leather bondage gear blowing things up in 360 slow-mo. Natural City actually sits back and tells a tells a story without bludgeoning us with Matrix-lite effects. This is as much a sad tale of love denied as it is a renegade cop, a cyborg, a ""hooker with(out) a heart of gold"" and the military-industrial complex of a the future. YES, the story is derivative of Blade Runner. Most, if not all, sci-fi of today is derivative of either Blade Runner, Mad Max or 1984. Move on. Enjoy the good stuff when it happens. LOVED the fact that they did not stomp all over the subtleties of this movie with the standard industrial metal soundtrack that is de riguer in much sci-fi. The piano score was haunting and kept us grounded in R's sorrow for his pending loss.

IMDb,False,"This is an interesting movie and will appeal to Philip K Dick and Blade Runner fans. Possibly. Out of curiosity, if nothing more. It's sort of based more on Blade Runner than the book on which that was based - Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep - and it's more a follow-on than a retelling. Cyborgs (Replicants), Blade Runners (MPs), limited life spans and attempts to counteract it. You get the idea. Fans will be thinking Great! But it's nowhere near the same calibre as Blade Runner. It's confusing, poorly-paced and substitutes action sequences for moments of tension. One highlight - which is probably not much of a highlight, really but which I enjoyed - is the music at 1:30 which just shouts Ennio Morricone. It fits the scene beautifully. The movie has much to recommend it it but ultimately falls short as a ""Blade Runner"" or ""Sheep"" adaptation or follow-on. However, fans of either owe it to themselves to watch it and make up their own minds.

And even then, it just didn't do much justice to the movie that the story trotted along at a fairly slow pace, making it lose its power of impact along the way - sort of think a balloon that is losing its air. The movie started out great, but quickly turned into a mish-mash storyline that just spiraled downward story-wise. As for the scenery, CGI and action, well it was all top notch, and it is almost just worth sitting through the movie to watch this, because they really went all out here, putting together a very believable universe that is vibrant, detailed and very realistic.

RottenTomatoes,False,"To relinquish Natural City to the ""Blade Runner"" copycat bin, which so many reviews do, and which might seem the obvious and correct thing at first go, does the film something of a 
disservice. 

It struck me that while it works off of the same ""conceptual fabric"" as Ridley Scott's vision of the PKD novel, it was, under the surface, a different film in a number of ways, and offers a dystopean vision that is uniquely Korean with cultural and sociological reference points which understandably Scott and North American audiences do not usually have the experiencial palatte to grasp without a great deal of effort and attention. While east and west have some shared iconography of what a decaying society is like, they also have many that are idiosyncratic.

It took me several viewings but it struck me as eerily beautiful in its own right. One simple example is the relationship between R and the cyborg doll Ria. When contrasted with theirs, the dialogue and body language expressed between Deckard and Rachel shows us a rather cold and distant pairing. Korean film is much more emotionally sophistocated than what we are usually fed in North America.

I understand the temptation of some reviewers I've read elsewhere, to parse N.C. as an example of what has become a common trend in the film industry of generating endless cheap productions that have titles close enough or Trailers that are visually similar enough to a blockbuster in order to confuse the ticket buyer and video renter (or more appropriately now-video streamer). This production does use the shiny-glossy Ridley Scott marketable window dressing of B.R. but would argue that this is only a veneer that wipes off fairly quickly. Perhaps the marketers did want to generate some confusion, but the creative people behind the film slipped in some herbal flavouring of their own into the audiences bubble tea.

Perhaps I am over valuing the cultural ligaments of the film (I watched this in the midst of an orgy of viewing dozens of S. Korean films), but I believe they invest it with enough of a unique vision that it removes the film from the category of ""cheap Blade Runner knock-offs"" and makes it of value to watch.  Perhaps it belongs on a shelf next to the one which holds B.R. rather than on the shelf below it.",Natural City,2003,Eastern

RottenTomatoes,False,"""Ria, let's get away to Muyoga.""
A visually stunning film that was clearly inspired by Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, that would have been better if the plot hadn't been so choppy.
Plot: The year is 2080. The planet is connected by a massive high tech computer network. Robots and cyborgs have been integrated into the population. The cyborgs have many uses ranging from companion ""dolls"" to soldiers. They have a three year lifespan, after which they malfunction, but some with the help of black market technology, can download their artificial intelligence into a human host. Two cops named R and Noma hunt down these renegade cyborgs. R has a doll named Ria who's lifespan is nearly up. The problem is that he's fallen in love with her and doesn't want to see her expire. Now with the expiration date only days away, he must make the decision of finding her a human body and running away with her to the paradise planet called Muyoga, or help Noma stop a renegade cyborg from starting a robot uprising.
If you can keep up with the story, this is actually pretty good. As well as being inspired by Blade Runner, I noticed some references to Ridley Scott's other Sci-fi film, Alien. There are a few scenes that seem to be directly copied from those movies. The effects are top notch. The fast paced action sequences sprinkled throughout the movie are very well done. I loved them and this is coming from a guy who's not that big on action movies. It was interesting to see the slow malfunction of Ria over the course of the film, but I feel that they could elaborated on that a little more. My only real complaint about this was the story and that really brought the film down for me. It was neither complicated nor stupid. It just wasn't that coherent and it never really made clear what it was trying to convey. But other than that, I really enjoyed it and would watch it again.

Ji-tae Yu is the main character and he is in love with a robot played by Rin Seo.  Rin Seo was a little off on her acting skills, but I did enjoy Ji-tae Yu's performance.  Jae-un Lee plays the other big part and she is decent.  Now the movie has a couple fight scenes and they were pretty intense.  They were all in bullet time slow motion and it really gave a stronger feel to them.  The only problem was that you wanted more, and there just wasn't enough.  There is a great fight scene between Ji-tae Yu and Doo-hong Jung though.  It was not that long and I really wanted to be.  But it was still great to watch.

Rajnikant shows why he is perceived as the superstar he is.He is quite amazing in his double role although he also could be very off at times. I think that is the directions fault. Overall this movie isn't meant to make you think but to to entertain. Even when some serious subjects are getting discussed here.

IMDb,False,"All is grand and great with 'Enthiran'. From frame one till the last, there is enough thrill, spill and chill that one would normally associate with Rajinikanth. Perhaps it is double here. The magic of Rajinikanth and the aura of Shankar have been combined well to weave a magic on screen. Come to describe Rajinikanth in Enthiran, we may run short of adjectives and adverbs. As scientist Vaseegaran and as robot Chitti, the top actor sizzles. He is cool and suave as Vaseegaran. More intellectual and stylish, he charms one and all. Sporting a stylish beard, Rajinikanth appears in trendy costumes in flashy colours. He has exemplary energy and enormous screen presence quite like any other films of him in the past. Not far behind is beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who missed few chances before to act with Rajinikanth. In 'Enthiran', she is cool and casual. The beauty with brains lends dignity to her role. Walking away with applause is Mozart of Madras A R Rahman. All his songs are catchy, foot-tapping and trendy. The songs like 'Kadhal Anukkal.', 'Robo Dance', 'Boom Boom' or 'Kilimanjaro', all evoke thunderous applause. Rahman's mastery in blending orchestration, harmony and rhythm add pep to all the numbers. The lyrics too compliment the songs and the theme of the movie. The legend in Vairamuthu, his novice son Kargy and Pa Vijay deserve applause. Come to master of the ship – Shankar. The man of many achievements, who brought grandeur to Tamil cinema, has lived up to his reputation. His dream project which eventually hit the screens is nothing short of fun, frolic and excitement. Known for handling mass themes with much ease, here he combines such elements with science. A theme never heard before in Indian cinema, Enthiran, is nothing but a milestone movie. Shankar has added one more jewel in his crown.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Endhiran, The Robot is definitely going to be a Biggest Blockbuster of Indian Cinema. 1. Budget is $35m, most expensive movie in Asia. 2. 2250 prints, 3000 screens, largest worldwide screening after 'Spiderman'.1400 screens in Tamil Nadu alone including 48 out of 52 screens in Chennai. 3.In three language versions, Tamil,Telugu & Hindi. 4. The special effects are as good as Hollywood movies like Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla which is composed of 1500 graphical shots. 5. Double Academy Award Winner AR Rahman has scored the music. This is a story of android based humanoid named Chitti.The first part in Endhiran movie has lot of surprises and rest half has actions and rides. In Endhiran, Rajni plays double role. One is a scientist and another is a Robot. Scientist Rajni creates a Robot with artificial intelligence like that of sixth sense in humans to help human beings and to the development of the country.But its silicon heart falls in love with Aishwarya Rai. Writes romantic poems and the Robot behave just like a human being. Knowing about the extra ordinary intelligence of the Robot the villains try to get control of the Robot. The last 30 minutes of the film are literally the grandmaster of all make-believe and end up creating a whole new genre of cinema: the 'curry eastern' which stands up as a wholesome alternative to the curry western. For Rajnikanth fans, the climax is definitely a sure-fire way to lose your sanity. For non-Rajnikanth fans, it's a sure-fire way to understand the mystique and magical allure of Rajni sir, a hero who enjoys a demi-god status in several parts of India. Why? Because there are almost a hundred Rajnikanths eating up helicopters, smashing cars, battering planet earth and creating havoc, like never before. If you thought Terminator, Matrix, Godzilla was fun, then we guarantee you'll fall off your chair with glee as our desi T2-meets-Blade Runner-meets Neo-meets-Godzilla sets the screen on fire in a crazy, vengeance bid. Spoofy, yes. But super fun too. Robot is primarily designed as an unadulterated tribute to the charisma of Indian cinema's ageless superstar, Rajnikanth. And it's completely, wholeheartedly, joyously desi. Where else would you find a hero who literally shoots with his fingers! What's more important is the fact that you actually don't mind when the bullet whizzes out of his forefinger and hits the man in front in the head. Instant death! Ha Ha! The high point of Robot are the super quality special effects. All the Spiderman, Batman and Superhero antics of Rajnikanth have been done with exquisite elan by the Stan Winston Studio which reportedly provided the animatrics for films like Jurassic Park and Avatar. And all the stunts have been choreographed by Yuen Woo Ping, the Hong Kong based action director who created the high-adrenalin stunts of classics like Kill Bill and Matrix. Almost 40 per cent of the film's colossal budget (Rs 160 crores) has been spent on special effects, which, at the end of the day, seems all worthwhile. For watching Rajnikanth running horizontal on a speeding train, clambering across burning buildings like Spiderman or mutating into gargantuan monsters does manage to shock and awe the viewer who's out there to have big time fun. But Robot isn't effect alone. It has a plot too which, if you really pay attention, has a meaning and a message. The film carries forward the man-machine war through interesting twists and turns and creates a lively love triangle between scientist Rajnikanth, medico student Aishwarya Rai and robot Rajnikanth. Interestingly, the duo make an interesting pair, what with Rajni sir's sundry wigs and sideburns and Aishwarya's tribal 'Kilimanjaro-Mohenjodaro' attire. You might just overdose on the pungent masala fare. Have a blast. For Tamil audience, this movie is a definite 10 out of 10!",Enthiran,2010,Eastern

IMDb,False,"I have to admit that I haven't seen much of Superstar Rajnikanth's films in their entirety, other than the wonderful Annamalai many, many years back, and it firmly remains one of my favourites, so you can imagine the thrill of watching the Superstar on the big screen cementing his status as one of Kollywood's greatest again. He plays two roles here in a biblical take on creation, being the scientific creator Dr. Vaseegaran who's latest achievement after 10 years, is to develop a robot (christened Chetti by the Dr's mom) with an advanced neural networks, which is also played by the Superstar himself devoid of emotions, because feelings is something every computer scientist knows we're not quite there yet since programming more than not involves codes of logic, the rational and things explainable through maths, rather than the irrational based on emotion. But being human is to have feelings and to express them, and that primarily separates machines from humans. In essence the story, besides being a romance, is an examination into the difference between man and machine, and the caution that should one day we get to such an advanced state of artificial intelligence that Isaac Asimov's laws of robotics have to be seriously looked into, and if one can truly program irrationality, then bear in mind that it comes with the negative traits associated with being human, Vaseegaran finds out that playing god and the proud acknowledgement of that ability comes with a degree of responsibility outside of hugging his creation each time it sings his praises, before the narrative turns in the second half into something darker, with betrayal and the severance of ties between Vaseegaran and Chetti. And all this because of a woman too. The story before the interval dwells more on the romance or lack thereof between Vaseegaran and Sana (Aishwarya Rai Bachchan), and takes on a rather playful nature in between the creation of the titular robot, and that of his abilities in assisting Sana through her studies, whipping up gastronomical meals, beating up thugs who disturb the peace, and provided for an entertaining fight sequence onboard a train involving the systematic destruction of the train cabin as thugs get slammed left, right and center by Chetti, which I'm sure in a packed house will have audiences applauding with approval. Bit by bit we see what Chetti is capable of, and highlights Vaseegaran's claim that it can dish out efficiencies and strengths of 100 men, before it starts to take on a new challenge in understanding feelings and emoting them, and with Love being as irrational as it is, proves to be a handful for a robot's comprehension as he starts to get romantically obsessed with Sana. But Chetti, in disappointing terms, is created none other than as a weapon for the army, which I thought geared very much to the real world where anything that can be weaponized will, running contrary to the fantastical take of the narrative thus far, which provided a talking point for the filmmakers to preach about the virtues of love over war, and why man cannot for once abandon that thought for love, which we are equally capable of. Embarrassed by his creation, Vaseegaran destroys Chetti only for his rival (Danny Denzongpa) to pick up the pieces and provide his own little code to transform Chetti into a killing machine, which provided for almost all the action sequences in the second half of the film to the point of excessiveness, an opportunity to see the Superstar in hundreds of numbers creating an army of itself and a fortress in which to house the kidnapped Sana. And trust me when I say the final act of the film involves some very loud battles between robots and soldiers that made it seem like you're watching a disaster flick with Transformers. Clocking in at 170 minutes, there were a few redundant scenes here that could have been done away as it didn't move the narrative forward, like the scene involving Chetti communicating with mosquitoes (yes you read that right). The action sequences in the film are unlike what I've seen in any Indian film to date, and puts them on par with what Hollywood does in terms of designing and executing them flawlessly between live action and computer animation, though at times it's easy to detect where the money shots were placed. A.R. Rahman's music provided the right touches in the film although I would think the song and dance numbers were a little long – especially those that came in to justify the love between Vaseegaran and Sana – that were made bearable only by the excellent dance choreography, which both Superstar and Aishwarya seem very comfortable in performing. Like a typical Indian masala film, this one has the right mix of everything – song, dance, action, romance, and plenty of effects thrown in to make it look ahead of its time. for being an entertaining broad crowd pleaser. Superstar Rajnikanth is at his element here playing 3 different roles - the professor, the good Chetti and evil Chetti, and anyone who suspects Aishwarya's dance ability should be convinced without a doubt she has all the right moves here, because that's what actually shines through given her rather muted role as the medical undergraduate at awe with her boyfriend's ability to build a walking, talking and feeling robot protector. All in, Endhiran is a case in point in the maturing of the Indian film industry in terms of their technical knowhow, just like how the advanced Chetti got created as a labour of love.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Can you always get the best results with the best ingredients? The answer is YES, YOU CAN. Provided you have an actor/superstar who listens to his director, an actress/global celebrity who just glows on screen throughout the movie and if the big budget is totally justified. All the credit for this extravagant movie goes to Shankar Shanmugam. The man is an absolute genius. His creativity reaches great heights with this movie and elevates the Indian movie standard to an all time high. With every movie of his, the scale of movie-making grows tremendously. He got the best technology money can buy. Looks like the majority of the budget is spent on Animatronics and this movie has got plenty of that. Rajinikanth is magnificent in this movie. In fact, he is the movie. He adds life to every single frame created by Shankar. Aishwarya does what she does best, look GORGEOUS.She has some pretty slick dance moves in the songs. The Animatronics are the best you could find in any movie so far and not just an Indian movie. The songs are spectacular. Shankar shows the audience some of the best places in the world all for a few bucks. The locations are mind-blowing and totally unique to this movie. Shankar handpicked the locations for the songs and they are shot on a grand scale. The music is haunting and highly entertaining. This movie will surely become one of the biggest movies ever made in India and without a doubt bring in a lot of moolah to the producers, distributors and the exhibitors all around the world. Rajinikanth redefines super stardom. Truly, a legend of a man.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern
IMDb,False,"This movie has once again shown that Tamil industry is going nowhere. I mean come on, I expected a lot from this movie. But once again lot of marketing strategy marred the movie. I have been a fan of Kamal and Rajini (almost all of Balachander's) for a long time. Rajini has sure got talent but I cant stand it anymore of it being completely misused. Aishwarya Rai in this movie is just being used to show up and for songs(the glamor factor). Of late almost all of tamil movies does it. They have no roles for Heroine. They base their movies solely on Hero and what more they add more spicy stuff to the movie. As famous Vivek Dialogue goes ""We even make Jackie Chan to speak Madras Tamil"". Now we made, what should be a serious, breathtaking, feverish movie into a masala mix. Unless we stop bringing stuff into a movie just because of the external pressure to do so, Tamil Industry is gonna struggle. Probably most people would understand it's about the songs. This movie doesn't warrant the kind of songs it has. Neither Shivaji nor Endhiran were Shankar-isque or Rajini-isque movies. Just like Kamal did in Dasavatharam, these two have made a mistake of allowing the character to compensate the plot. Hope my two greats Rajini and Legendary Kamal come back to their own.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Rajini Kanth Magic: Whats Magic? Its a Power to make you sit and watch a Person is doing and here it is... Its Sheer magic of Rajini. He had given us a Completely new Indian film. This Movie will prove in all ways, who is the super star of India. Endhrian Movie Review You would have heard about Western Style, Western Movie etc.. Now, here after there is one more, That is Eastern, its Eastern Style, the RAJINI Style. Rajini and Shankar will always be remembered as the Persons responsible for making a movie that will literally reduce the gap between Hollywood and Indian Movies. They are responsible for the Giant Step Tamil Film Industry had taken. Endhiran is Indian and is Desi meets western and let we call the new genre of film making as Eastern. The Highlight of the Endhrian is its Special Effects, that you can match this movie with any Hollywood movies. Yes this movie is - perhaps the first Indian Science Fiction movie which is successful and high in Special EFX. Here all Spidar Man, Hancock, Hulk, Superman become one man and its amazing that for the first time we are going to accept an Indian Desi Hancock. Its hard to identify Special Efx used in most of the Scenes. The Special Efx in the last 45 Minutes is breath taking and very creative, not taken or inspired from any Hollywood movies like Blade or I Robot or Spider Man or Hancock. He had introduced a new Genre and which is going to be repeated in the future, this movie is going to inspire many and many Future Indian film Directors. The Movie is Big, Grand and Explosive. Final 15 or 20 Minutes will keep you at the edge of your seat. You will witness the greatest ever SP EFX Indian Movie or even Asian movie. Dialogues: Dialoges are very good and easy to understand for anybody. Its simple and convey the message easily. Eg: Person 1: Do God Exist? Chitti: What you mean by GOD? Person 1: Our Creator. Chitti: Then, Yes, (Pointing Vaseegaran) he is my God, my Creator. On the whole: The Movie is going to break all kind of Indian Box Office records. The movie has everything, whatever the Team had promised before. Great achievement by SUN Pictures and S Shankar. Look out for the Final 20 Minutes, the Magnetic EFX, the Giant ROBO, The Snake, Rajini's Dialoges and his Face expressions in the last quarter. This movie is not a Masterpiece but is Path Breaking with its breath Taking Visuals. The film is a Visual Treat and technically way ahead of any Indian Movies.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern

As compared to first half, second half won't entertain you much. You can witness the usual Rajini stunts and styles. The music and BG score by ARR and sound mixing by Resul Pookkutty is not that interesting. Just a usual one. To be precise, I was not able to see the ARR/Resul magic in it. But still, overall, its a nice watch. Even if you're not a Rajini fan, watch it for the brilliant graphics and technical perfection. Will rate 7/10. P.S:- When the movie head towards its climax, there is a scene in which Rajini and his clones form a huge snake. Amazing. A must watch in theater.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I happened to see Robot (Hindi Version) a few days back. Believe me, I am ashamed to even commit to my friends that I saw this crap. The Movie is silly from the beginning and never delivers anything intelligent, which is expected from a science fiction. I feel sorry for Rajnikanth who has compromised so much, just to please his fan base. It is difficult to believe that he is the same person who stared in the movie-Thalpathi (Mani Ratnam). Coming back to Robot. My question for Mr.Shankar is when he is going to give us an intelligent and a smart film. I have no complains with the special effects, they were very well executed and were of Hollywood standards. Specially the final ten minutes. However, there was nothing like a story in the movie. It was predictable from the first scene and was longer than required and top of it, there were just too much songs. Songs were poor and lyrics were just pathetic. The twists were stupid and did not fit in with theme of the movie. In terms of acting, Rajni is acceptable as the scientist and unbearable as the Robot. Mrs.Bachaan, it seems is signing everything coming at her hand these days, so no complains from her, because we all know what she is capable off. Mr.Danny, I understand you have no work these days, so you are pardoned for being a part of this foolish, dramatic and shameless movie. It is these movies which draws the Indian Film industry backwards. I pity the people who consider this as entertainment and spend thousand of rupees in watching this crap.

IMDb,False,"This is the greatest treat for Rajinikanth's fans. I watched the movie at Cochin. Most of the theaters were running the film and a huge crowd to watch it. Android concepts have not been a subject of Indian films as they may not be understandable to the common masses. But this film has depicted the concept in a very simple yet in a good fashion. Though the story line seems to be quite common, the acting of superstar in his dual role as an android and the scientist both done in a beautiful manner. Beauty queen Aiswarya rai has also done her role quite well. This movie will become the stepping stone to many movies in the same genre which may come in future. I liked the last few scenes very much in this movie because of the creativity and originality in the stunt scenes in which the androids take the shape of a sphere, cylinder, and most interesting and awesome was the form of a cobra. It is definitely creative...very good. The message however was very disheartening to see that in conclusion any advent in science & technology is termed to dangerous and hostile and it should be quarantined. In the movie, They still keep the android in a museum even after completion of 20 years. The message could have been a little different though stating that the advent of technology is good.",Enthiran,2010,Eastern

IMDb,False,"After the demise of S. Rangarajan, the last two films of Shankar (not including 'Nanban', which was a remake anyway) have had to rely on expanding the horizons of visual effects (and other such gimmicks) in Indian cinema. The costliest Indian film to date, 2.0, suffers from Rangarajan's absence big time. The dialogues don't strike a chord with the general audience the way they're supposed to - amid all the scientific mumbo jumbo (about photons, positive energy, and aura), there are scenes explaining everything in common-man language (including a sly reference to the 2G scam) - but even they are not humorous or clever enough. 2.0 essentially boasts a screenplay that Shankar carefully penned to inculcate one VFX-based set-piece after another, each getting grander in terms of scale. Rajini is restrained and quite boring as both Dr. Vaseegaran and the original Chitti, and he goes into full-Rajini mode only during towards the end. The blame is, again, directed to the writing department. There are no scenes that make us want to know Dr. Vaseegaran more as a person. In fact, he is as robotic as his personal aide, Nila (played by Amy Jackson). It was quite sad to see even a 'female robot' suffer from the male gaze (in one of the early scenes in the film). We wait for the quintessential Shankar flashback to drive the film forward storywise, and to give the audiences a strong, well-written reason as to why one of the film's characters (this time, the antagonist Pakshi Rajan, played by Akshay Kumar) does what he does. Pakshi Rajan's backstory is a pretty good one (again not going into scientific depths; this is a sci-fi masala potboiler) and Akshay manages to make his Tamil debut a memorable one (and probably the only character worth caring for in the whole movie, even though he is the 'designated bad guy' who has to go against Rajini Kanth - not one or two, thousands of them!). Shankar, by now, has realized that he can only go forward with films that require a large canvas, elaborate set-pieces, and quirky costumes and make-up. The VFX visionary in Shankar is seen in an extended scene where people (pertaining to various strata of life)'s cellphones start flying in the air for a while to eventually form the scavenger eagle that is Pakshi Rajan. And there are numerous such scenes! However, I did not enjoy a gimmick that the deranged version of Chitti tries to pull off on Pakshi Rajan during the climax sequence, which goes against the message (or rather, the morality) that the film tried to uphold in the first place. Almost every shot requires visual effects in some form or the other; the effort has gone into making it all look great on screen is, without a doubt, astonishing. If only the same kind of effort was put into the writing too, we would have gotten a sci-fi masterpiece in our hands; but no, not happening!",2.0,2018,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Only focus in VFX.
No logic in movie .Message is good but story is week..I saw this movie in 3D. Hindi dubbing is so bad.",2.0,2018,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The plot of this movie is utterly bizarre. The opening sequence is really good and made me excited for what was to follow. Unfortunately what was to follow was unbelievable. It just makes no sense whatsoever. The movie is trying to provide an environmental message, but in the most ridiculous of methods. Had a movie been made which addressed that message in a more grounded way, it could have been interesting. This was simply far too much though. Almost all the performance in this film is atrocious. Ranjinkanth as Chitti was unintentionally laughable. He was an old man trying to act like a superhero robot. Unfortunately whenever he tried to run or do anything physical you could see the amount of effort required. I felt sorry for him. I just imagined him finishing an action scene and needing a week to recover. He wasn't helped too much either by his co-star Akshay Kumar who plays the antagonist Pakshi Rajan. Although the subplot involving his character is good, the character in whole is poorly written. The make-up effects don't look good. To be honest, nobody came out of this looking good, except maybe Amy Jackson who plays another robot and looks amazing. What's even more shocking is that the silly-looking poor CGI costs $76 million, making it Bollywood's most expensive ever film. I have no idea where the money went because this film had the visuals of something from the nineties. There's a big fight scene at the end of the movie that's so ridiculously exaggerated it makes me think it was put there solely to insult the intelligence of the viewer. There was just so much obvious green screen. Overall, 2.0 is admirable for the ambition to create this huge sci-fi blockbuster but the execution was beyond terrible.",2.0,2018,Eastern

IMDb,False,"2.0 is undoubtedly a giant leap for the Indian movie industry! Positives first: Shankar, his vision, VFX & 3D: The maximum, an Indian movie has ever achieved, that is so close to the Hollywood standards. A very satisfying and convincing work, with such a limited budget (comparing with Hollywood films). Grand imaginations and an ambitious work by the director! Rajini Factor: Although Vasigaran and Good Chitti characters could not impress us much, Rajinikanth starts his rage with 2.0 and 3.0 characters. He nails them to perfection with proper entertainment value. 2.0 is the true Indian superhero, with a lot of potential future projects. Akshay Kumar: His dedication is impressive. His acting in the flashback portion is very natural and he deserves an applause for accepting that character. AR Rahman's BGM and Nirav Shah's camera work lift the movie to another level. Negative: An underwhelming and weak storyline that is easily predictable. Screenplay is flat, without any interesting cat-and-mouse moments between the protagonist and antagonist. Given that most of the superhero films in the Hollywood too have such simple and predictable storylines, the only negative of the film can be magnanimously ignored. Go watch this indigenous product, that will definitely make you proud as an Indian!",2.0,2018,Eastern
IMDb,False,"It's a sure ENTERTAINER!!!. The 1st half was a little boring, but it really took off from the 2nd part, Akshay Kumar's performance was amazing. Rajinikanth has just nailed it. He is great as Chitti, It was a little over the top, he could've been a little subtle, but nevertheless enjoyable! VFX was mind-blowing, best in Indian cinema till now! but a little inconsistent in some parts, 3D effects were really good, one of the best 3D experiences. Everyone should watch this movie atleast for the sheer fun and entertainment it offers throughout the runtime. Another thing is that some people are criticizing it for the movie being illogical, but trust me, I'm doing my computer science engineering, and the logic was good enough to take in. But, I watched the movie not for it's science, but for grandeur and fun the movie offers! Conclusion: S.Shankar is really creative with the VFX and offers some interesting visual treats! But only if he could've been a little more creative with the story, it could be the best movie of Indian cinema. At the end, it's a must watch. You wouldn't want to miss the fun.

You have movies like badhai ho and andhadhun which are low budget movies which everyone loved. What was this?

IMDb,False,"Robot released in 2009 is still a benchmark for all Indian Film as far as VFX part is concerned, who could have surpassed it other than its Sequel? 2 point 0 promises to be a Biggest Visual Spectacle ever and it is actually that Never Seen Before Visual Treat for all Indian Cineviewers. Shankar has done it, he did it 9 yeras ago too, he does it again. Shankar has successfully achieved that Ground Breaking VFX with 2 Point 0. If you are concerned about Big Budget of around 450cr then i assure you that it did not go in Vain. That money is spent on Whatever Mind-Boggling Visual Effects you see it on Screen and it Completely worths it. The question comes on obvious note that did a Landmark Film like Robot deserve a Sequel? If yes, then will it be able to the match the same phenomena? The Anwer is Yes, 2 Point 0 Surpassed the Benchmark set by Robot on Visual Level by Margin but it lacked the same conviction and Logic like its Predecessor. Technical Team and Shankar Deserves a Standing Ovation for Never Seen Before Visual Effects and i request all of you to watch the Film in Theatre and in 3D only. But there is something less in script for sure, some scenes doesn't make sense at all, some looked outdated. A sloppy Screenplay and high scientific technic theme might be difficult to digest, especially for masses. At some scenes Chitti looked very tiny, as if we are watching him in a Video Game. Actors didn't get much scenes to do acting, less use of BGM etc are tye some minuses to mention. Overall, i am confused whether to Praise Shankar a lot for some never seen before and Biggest Spectacle Ever or to bash him for not working on the script? No doubts, 2 Point 0 is A GROUND BREAKING FILM for Indian Cinema and it will take many years for other Indian Films to surpass it Practically. Visual Department was focused but Little more attention towards the Script and this one would have been a LANDMARK FILM from all the aspects. As a whole it's a Good One Time Watch for sure, there is nothing disappointing in the film. It is just the matter of what level film you are expecting. Talking about the Box Office, this was the only film which could have challenged Bahubali 2 Domestic Records but now i can say Bahubali 2 Safe. RATING- 6/10*",2.0,2018,Eastern

IMDb,False,"So after being in development for like, 8 years, what do we finally get for a sequel of one of the greatest Tamil movie of all time? A blatant natalist propaganda. To be honest this movie seemed to just go with the flow. Like the famous saying goes, ""Maybe the treasure was the friends I made along the way."", this movie's saying is, ""Maybe the movie is the trends I picked up along the way."" Because that's literally what this movie has done - pick up everything that came since 2010. So the movie begins with Nila, Vaseegaran's new robot. Now I have several questions. Firstly, how on earth did Vaseegaran make another robot? Wasn't it clearly mentioned at the end of Endhiran that he is not allowed to make robots? Didn't Chitti get dismantled at the end and then get shown to be that way till 2030? Secondly, in the first movie it was said that Vaseegaran took 10 years to make Chitti. So how did he make Nila like, almost immediately? Even if we consider he just copy-pasted the codes, still he has to make an entirely new model from scratch. And thirdly, why did he make it after Amy Jackson? Because she had become very famous back then? They don't even talk about Sana, as if she just, disappeared. So let's get the idea behind Pakshi Rajan. He's an ornithologist who wants to remove cell phone tower radiation because it kills birds. Dude, first of all, get your facts straight. Towers only cause disturbance, they don't KILL birds! Throughout the movie whenever anyone said no one dies of tower radiation, he would always reply by saying that they should try spending 24 hours under a tower. I mean, okay then? I lived in a village which had a huge tower right next to it. I stayed there for about 17 years, and at max I only got tinnitus. So there goes your emotional appeal. This movie was clearly made with the intentions that kids will stop using their phones with the fear that it may damage the ecosystem. To this I will say only one thing: Okay, boomer! And the CGI. The goddamn CGI. Baahubali was made at 1/3rd the cost of this movie and had a way more realistic CGI. The way Pakshi Rajan's soul peacefully comes out and then turns evil with a jumpscare was so predictable and hilariously bad. All the birds clearly looked animated. The action scenes were okay-ish, but I found Pakshi Rajan's CGI kinda disgusting. He needed more than just fake feathers. There's a reason why humans aren't birds. Such a look is only good for a KFC mascot, not for an intimidating villain. Finally, the part that bothers me the most: The message that this movie wants to give. Like mentioned above, this movie wants us to stop using cell phones because it will destroy the environment. Vaseegaran blatantly speaks it out in the end. And the other message that this movie wants to give is, also briefly mentioned in the beginning, natalist propaganda. No matter how many wrong things humans do, even if they kill and destroy the environment for their own greed, they will always be considered correct. I wouldn't have had this problem if Pakshi Rajan won in the end. I was absolutely routing for him. But this wasn't the case. So I'm absolutely disappointed. 2.0 could have been one of the best movies ever made if it was made with a proper story, decent CGI and any relation with its prequel. Instead it felt like a cash grabber that just wanted to make enough money to get out of its production hell. I'm really disappointed and trust me, I get no fun trashing this movie.

RottenTomatoes,False,"The plot wouldn't make it on daytime television, The special effects are truly terrible. Don't get me wrong, artistically it looks great--the 3D modeler did great work, and even the idle animations are okay for the technological enemy. However, the animation of the special effects is absolutely ridiculous, there is no weight to the renderings. They don't feel real, they don't move in a realistic way, it feels like a comedy when there is action on the screen. Additionally, the acting is a complete mixed bag with the majority of the main cast being excellent, but far too many are distractingly boisterous. I can only assume those side characters were trying to grab the spotlight by acting over the top. Perhaps they knew this movie was going to be big worldwide, and wanted to get their slice of the fame. I don't really care, it broke the immersion almost as bad as the animation of the various special effects objects. Also I know I mentioned the plot already, but dear god, dear god, dear God. The plot is atrocious. A true abomination of a concept that was bad from the very beginning. If a random person's ghost can haunt the entire world and destroy everything by controlling all electronics, your universe is basically toast. Why wouldn't this happen again? Why wouldn't it happen in different ways, constantly? If a ghost can destroy the entire world by controlling everything related to its death, there are literally billions of ""negative energy"" suicides that should have the same problem. Every car would be possessed by the suicidal gas station attendant, every washer and dryer would try to wash and tumble dry you to death when the laundromat owner kicked the bucket on a bad day, and all your pizza would blow you up from the inside if ever Papa John got sick of being memed and finally decided to clock out (yes, this movie did explode someone from the inside with the magically flying, negative energy, ghost-controlled cell phones).

The fact that this movie has anything above a 30% on Rotten Tomatoes has forever ruined my ability to take this site seriously. It is a joke, a sick lie everyone is telling themselves. I don't mind Indian content making it to the big screen worldwide, just like I don't mind Anime (i.e. Dragonball/Pokemon) coming to theaters. But you are lying to yourself if you think this was a good movie. At best, this was ""So bad it's good"" in the same vein as ""The Room"". And the positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes for this movie will forever be a stain on the legitimacy of reviews here. Especially by these so-called ""Critics"". I expect the giant Indian audience with their pro-Indian move bias to give it high marks and outnumber the Westerners, I don't expect this from the critics though. This movie is trash, the kind of trash you couldn't pay me to watch if it went direct to DVD and was sold for free (as if anyone even has a DVD player left these days).

This is right up there with Godzilla 2000, with regards to how absolutely deranged and deluded its fans are. Why this kind of garbage exists will always amaze me.

IMDb,False,"This movie was actually somewhat of a surprise. I had bought it from Amazon without actually knowing what it was all about. It had gotten fairly good reviews on Amazon, plus it was an Asian movie, so I decided to give it a go. And now having seen it, I must say that ""Cyborg She"" was actually a really nice movie. It is a very interesting romantic movie of sorts, because it is not your average romance movie. You have Jiro who falls in love with a cyborg that he himself built in the future and sent back to himself in the past. Confusing? Well, a bit odd, but it made for a really nice story actually. And it worked out quite well. I especially liked the way the movie ended, because it rounded up so many questions that you were stuck with in the first part of the movie. The cast in ""Cyborg She"" was actually quite good. Haruka Ayase (playing the cyborg) and Keisuke Koide (playing Jiro) had really good chemistry on the screen. And I must admit that I was really taken in by Haruka Ayase's performance as the cyborg, and they had really managed to present her in a way that made her look sort of artificial. Not sure if this was based on an anime or manga, or not, but it sure had the feel like you were watching a live-action manga movie. Thumbs up on that. ""Cyborg She"" is one of the more interesting Asian movies I have seen in awhile, because it is somewhat beyond the stereotypical stuff that you see in Asian movies. This oddly romantic story will capture your heart and take you along on a very well-told journey. The movie offers everything from love and laughs to thrills and action. If you are a fan of Asian cinema, then you definitely should check out ""Cyborg She"".",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern

Whilst watching it I was occasionally reminded of several other films. Pros - A pleasant way to spend 2 hours Cons - Nothing new Overall - Compared with Kwak's high standards this is Average",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Sometimes the greatest love stories aren't the ones that end happily ever after, but the realization that it's all a matter of the quality moments spent between the lovers. You can call me a sentimental sap, but Cyborg She does meet every single one of my expectation of what makes a palatable romantic movie, never mind sometimes dwelling on the clichéd moments, especially when the leads share great chemistry, and this being a science-fiction piece to boot too! Jiro Kitamura (Keisuke Koide) is a loner who celebrates his birthday with nobody except himself, going to the mall and picking out his own gift, before ending up at the same old restaurant for a plate of spaghetti. It's a routine year after year, but in 2007, he chanced upon a girl (Haruka Ayase) whom he witnessed to have shoplifted from the departmental store, and from then they spend the most amazing evening together. Yes, it's reminiscence of Serendipity, done in the style of Kwak Jae-young, whom we know better as the writer-director of the Korean hit My Sassy Girl. Fast forward to a year later, Jiro meets the girl again, but this time discovers she's a cyborg sent from the future. I guess to most guys, this seemed like a dream come true when a girl, no matter if she's a fully functional cyborg, happened to just drop into your lap again. It's R2D2 with boobs, sent to him in Terminator fashion (Sorry, with clothes on too), which means of course that she has a higher calling and purpose to be with him, for reasons best I not reveal here, but for you to find out for yourself. Being an advance being, in between getting to learn how to be a human, protecting Jiro from harm and being romanced, she's also like a superhero, and Cyborg She never looked a minute out of place if positioned side by side with this year's Hollywood superhero blockbusters. Boasting excellent special effects, I thought this movie gave another Japanese Film (don't click on this link if you choose not to know) a run for its money with its rendition of the event being a more realistic one. It has plenty of charming moments within that makes it a perfect date movie, and the great chemistry between the leads is what made this work. Keisuke Koide looked like the helpless puppy that he is, flitting from moment to moment trying to figure out what his cyborg's true calling is, while succumbing unsuccessfully to temptation of trying to get fresh with her. Haruka Ayase on the other hand had her work cut out for her in being an emotionless robot programmed to smile, and had moments which mirrored Uma Thurman from My Super Ex-Girlfriend. Together they share some light hearted moments in a fine balance with the dramatic ones. And as we all know, we usually appreciate things a lot more the minute we lost them, and for a romantic movie, this usually is the case to reinforce certain emotions the characters have for each other. Running slightly more than 2 hours, it never for a minute felt longer than its welcome on screen, though I had to admit that amongst its multiple endings, I thought that it could have ended at any point, and still would have made it a bittersweet movie to have experienced. I've no qualms about the ending it decided upon too, but meanwhile for those whose hearts would feel heavy at the slightest touch of sentimentalism, you'd better pack your tissues with you. I'll admit it, this is a movie which I enjoyed thoroughly, even though as you know with any movie dealing with time travel, that'll be that bit of a paradox involved, and here it came in large doses. I'll advise you to accept the timeline presented for what it is, because that's the only way, linearly, in order to enjoy any movie that has this element. Highly recommended stuff since it's been some time I saw a romantic movie (and a science fiction one!) that just worked. I'll stick my neck out to say it'll likely be featured in my top 10 list of films for this year and I'll put money aside for the DVD as well. For those who want to watch it on the big screen, well it's been playing at the cinemas for some time now, so you'd better quickly make some time for it.",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I do not know about other people but I went to see this movie because it was directed form the same guy that made My Sassy Girl, Classic and Daisy. This guy really does have a good record of making romantic movie in different situation. He has his own style of making romantic movie and this is another of his hearth warming, cliché, intrigue and tear jerking movie. The stories about the lonely college student about to find his love that turn out to be the cyborg from the future send to protect him for the unknown reason. Though the story isn’t that original but hardly any movie does nowadays so it doesn’t quite really bother me, anyway it has been execute pretty well though slow from time to time and drag on and never end like AI: Artificial Intelligence. And in the end it got a too wrap up ending (at least for me). There are quite a few scenes that will managed to delivered what it suppose to bring and in the end (if you don’t felt bore by it first) it will be pretty much a heart touching story that really intrigue you. The casting, well I think it was pretty darn good, after all it seem to consist of only two main character and a few more that add little to the story. They do pretty much have a pretty great chemistry even though one of them is a robot. Overall I do pretty much like it though I felt it was overlong for it also got a very slow pace, but I do pretty much expected from this guy flick. So it was alright by my standard. In the end I didn’t felt riff-off so that is a good thing, though I highly doubt I will watch it again soon. Recommendation: I went to see it on big screen, but I highly recommend you rent DVD.

I have seen almost all movies in the top 250 on IMDb and much more, this movie is so underrated here, but it is near perfect. The only reason i can think of why people would rate this movie low is maybe because they don't like science fiction or don't like stories with far fetched technology, or maybe some special effects that aren't top notch like most movies today but other than that i cant come up with a reason. This is a beautiful masterpiece, a great storyline that is truly unique. I have never encountered this story in anything i ever watched, the budget may not be as high as most Hollywood movies but that is not important to me. This is a truly unique and beautiful movie, you can just feel that the creators have put their heart in it, and to me that is the most important factor. It is officially FIRST movie i ever shed a tear with, i didn't even cry with The Green Mile. I came here to rate the movie a 9 (wich i hardly do) and found out how terribly underrated it is so i just had to write a quick opinion. Sorry, this may not be very helpful for getting an idea of what the movie is about but you can find that elsewhere. I just wanted to write my feelings about this amazing movie, i think anyone should at least give it a try. The only reason why im not giving it a 10 is because of 1 or 2 very minor things that could have been done better or could have been left out, but it is so minor that it almost doesn't matter. 9/10",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern
IMDb,False,"""Jiro Kitamura"" (Keisuke Koide) is a lonely young man who has nobody to celebrate his birthday with him. That night while buying a present for himself he sees a beautiful young woman (played by Haruka Ayase) in the process of shoplifting some clothes in the department store and he watches with fascination as she leaves in a totally nonchalant manner. Their eyes meet and she smiles at him. Not long afterward he goes to a restaurant to celebrate his birthday and while he is eating she comes in and sits down next to him. What then transpires is a whirlwind evening that he remembers until his next birthday a year later. Now, rather than reveal what happens next and risk spoiling the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a cute little ""rom-com"" sci-fi which one might enjoy watching with somebody special. Having said that I should probably also mention that this movie was filmed in Japanese and used English subtitles. Additionally, there were a couple of scenes which were a little slow and drawn out. Even so, I thought that both Keisuke Koide and Haruka Ayase played their parts real well and for what it's worth I rate this movie as slightly above average.",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Seriously? Couldn't they have been a little more creative? The time travel/effect is exactly the same as The Terminator. They even use the same situation from the ending of Terminator 2, where Arnold has to break part of his body and dragging himself to the ground. Except, this is way cheesier and ridiculous scenario where it suddenly turns into a disaster film. It's more like they wanted to try to be like epic Hollywood production but it doesn't come close at all. Pretty sure this film is made for teenage girls and boys/anime otakus and that's where all the positive ratings are coming from. No full grown adult would find this film romantic or amazing. Then again, I don't think this film is right for little kids either because there's a scene where some fat terrorist just starts shooting a rifle at a restaurant and then he starts chugging down gasoline and ends up lighting up on fire. Cheesy effects and super cheesy story. The ending is super ridiculous. If they didn't have uplifting vibe and eyecandy from Haruka Ayase in this film, of course she's cute, I would have given a lower score.",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern

IMDb,False,"I've watched this movie so many times and I still enjoy it immensely. It is the only film that I can think of that covers pretty much all genres. Mostly it is a romance but also a sci-fi, mystery, comedy, tragedy, horror, thriller with plenty of twists that you don't see coming. The acting is superb from both of the lead stars and Ayasa Haruka is so adorable.
Tears of laughter and sadness will flow from most viewers whilst watching this story. The directing is spot on and the story will keep your attention from start to finish.
I would be surprised if many people could guess the ending as the final twist is really one of those WOW moments. Japanese movie makers are very good at stirring emotions and surprising audiences with twist. This epic movie is no exception. My rating 10/10!

IMDb,False,I watched this movie a week ago. I found the movie easy to follow and refreshingly clean and heartfelt. It shows that you don't need to have sex to be intimate and romantic. In fact it adds to the feeling. Unlike Hollywood movies that the beautiful girl has to undress and have a sex scene here we have a truly beautiful actress in an amazing romantic film and I don't remember a single kiss. Profound human emotions does not need physical expression. This has been lost in Hollywood moves for decades. In response to a reviewer who said the move is not good enough because she did not undress and not enough action. Please go back to your dumbed down Hollywood films made for lower IQ audience. This is a true romance not in the league of Ready for love but fun and enjoyable.,Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The title says all. The young man behaves like an idiot; his college friend is a jerk; his teacher is another idiot; the owner of the restaurant and the police officers are utterly dumb. The cyborg girl behaves like a spoiled brat, grown in the jungle. Ok. This is what Japanese comedy writers believe is funny? In addition: the cyborg girl is gorgeous, but the boy never tries to convince her of having sex (which would be reasonable and romantic, anyway)? Perhaps actors were under the impression that this was a mute film, so they have to exaggerate gestures and grimaces. They move like Japanese costumed superheroes battling a Godzilla type monster. They give the term expressionism a new height. Not funny for anybody over 5 years of age.",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern

IMDb,False,"Similar to The Fountain, Cyborg She, otherwise referred to as Cyborg Girl, or My Girlfriend Is A Cyborg, is a feature set over more than one time period, and shows how the smallest event can lead to the biggest catastrophes - and the best love stories. Based upon the Park Chan-wook film, I'm A Cyborg But That's Okay, writer/director Kwak Jae-yong (My Sassy Girl) makes a feature that is similar to Windstruck, which occasionally bore resemblance to the aforementioned film he is most known for directing. Rather than conceiving a feature about a young woman who thinks she's a cyborg, Haruka Ayase portrays a woman who actually IS a cyborg. Unlike films that secretly borrow concepts from other movies in the hopes that no one will notice, Cyborg She deliberately steals ideas from films like Terminator and Time Cop to create a story that not only makes a mockery of American classics (the Terminator references include the blue time bubble and a man hiding a weapon beneath his trench-coat), but creates a powerfully heartfelt romantic comedy in the process. Jiro Kitamura (Keisuke Koide) is a geek, who knows as much about women as I do. Despite been close friends with a fellow college student (Kenta Kiritani), Jiro spends much of his life alone, his own birthday reflecting his life's unflinching loneliness. That is, until he meets a young, beautiful, sassy, intelligent, humorous young woman (Ayase), and though they spend only one night together, she leaves an impression on him that he can never forget. So, you can imagine the shock he receives exactly one year later when the woman he has been unable to stop thinking about returns - only this time, she isn't entirely human. Discovering the origins of the woman he begins living with, Jiro finds himself falling in love with his robotic house-mate. The question remains: if a human can learn to fall in love with another, can the same be said for a cyborg? Ms. Ayase is brilliant in her role as the cyborg, her stiff movements, general ignorance regarding society and facial expressions, developing a character who truly is a machine, yet at the same time is capable of showing enough emotion to notify the audience of the humanity she may hold within. Mr. Koide is as equally impressive as the lovesick Jiro, the lustfully passionate feelings he exhibits towards his cyborg companion, alongside his angst at being unable to have a typical relationship with her, being adeptly conveyed. Upon discovering the woman of his dreams is not only a cyborg, but is from the future, Jiro says something akin to 'fair enough'. Not bothering to focus on the strangeness of these circumstances, the film is able to quickly move forward, uninhibited by irrelevant questions, however, those of you, who, after viewing the trailer believe the film will be a collection of action scenarios, think again. Much of the film works perfectly as a character drama, and on every other occasion, offers the audience side-splitting hilarity in the form of uniquely entertaining humor. The effects that accompany a number of the scenes are superbly delivered, and though they are not always the same caliber offered by Hollywood, they are fabulous all the same, and effectively bring more depth to the feature. A moment when the cyborg begins to illicit sparks after taking a swig of alcohol helps establish how she is presently inebriated, while another moment when the world around Jiro becomes hazy, is representative of him leaving contemporary society behind by entering a portal through time. Although much of the film is in chronological order, the feature doesn't entirely conform to this rule, the past and future of the characters being provided considerable depth, that assists us in understanding the present. This is accentuated by the score and chosen songs, which compliment much of the film, and assist the audience in comprehending the mood during every crucial moment. Cyborg She's conclusion moreover may leave audiences questioning the ending's authenticity, and though there are several possible interpretations that can be exhibited by Jae-yong's decisions, the film loses none of its influence. The intensity of the emotions steadily rise until the film's inescapable climax, and upon the credits making their way across the screen, its doubtful a single iris will remain dry. With this in mind, be sure you go into this film with a box of tissues. Despite there been moments in the film that don't entirely make sense, Cyborg She is one of those rare features that reminds us the best films, seldom have to.",Boku no kanojo wa saibôgu // Ela: Cyborg,2008,Eastern

The movie is trying to tell too many subjects' stories without telling one coherent story at all. They should have made this into a longer TV series, or simplified the story to focus on one, or even two out of the THREE story arcs. Visuals are stunning but often unnecessarily so. Pretty scenes that don't add any real content to the story.

The creators of this technology are not depicted as villains; rather, they are portrayed as ordinary individuals going about their work, coexisting with AI.

I thoroughly enjoyed ""Wonderland,"" and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates science fiction or is intrigued by the potential of AI.

IMDb,False,"The S/VFX were all top shelf in this film, but it had two downfalls; one was the constant cheesy and annoying attempts at humor which became cringeworthy fast. The other was the convoluted screenplay. The conceptual story was actually decent, but it ended up all style with very little substance. It was riddled with plot holes, and incohesive and incoherent dialogue. Even the normally comfortable 98 min runtime felt much longer with all the infantile dialogue, terrible humor and some of the long, dragged out and unnecessary scenes. Writer and director Sang-ho Yeon should have made many edits and scene cuts after seeing the final version to at lease create better cohesion. It's a generous 6/10 from me, mostly for the very impressive visuals.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Beware: if you want to watch this movie for a dosis of pure robots and action, you need to know this is not an action movie. It presents the drama revolving around a dystopian future where technology is used in unethical ways to serve big corporation and military complex purposes. Even it falls short in developing the characters and middle story, making it dull and slow at times, It excels at showing how the future would look like if the advancements in technology lead us away from our humanity. If you have the patience, i would recommend this movie for a dosis of some amazing key components about what awaits us if we remain unaware.

IMDb,False,"I love Korean made movies. Especially the sci-fi stuff. However, the only thing that I wish would happen is they get more gritty and realistic. People do not interact like they write into these movies. Dispense with the goofy material in a serious movie. It's not a comedy. Flipping from super serious to goofy comedy side characters is like cars crashing into one another. The transition is tough to deal with. People like serious movies. They also like comedies. But you gotta pick one. This one should have been all serious. Dispense with the dopey science assistants and improve a bit on the sci-fi effects, and you've got an 8-9 hit! But I don't want to detract from the general story which was still very good.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern

I went in with expectation of shoddy special effects or with so many special effects it lacked depth. I was WRONG. This movie is a gem. For me, this movie has a great balance of heart,depth, and action. Unlike so many recent Hollywood movies it gave me that nice balance. The acting was good, and I have watched and thoroughly enjoyed subtitled movies, and independent movies over most productions made in Hollywood. For a movie made in Korea, I was FLOORED, by how good it was. Seriously folks, Hollywood and the U.

IMDb,False,"Jung_E"" is a science fiction film set in an uninhabitable 22nd-century Earth, where the fate of a civil war rests on the shoulders of a single soldier. The story revolves around the cloning of the brain of an elite soldier to create a robot mercenary. On paper, the concept of the film sounds intriguing, but in execution, it falls short of expectations. The film tries to tackle complex themes like the ethics of war and the dangers of technology, but ultimately fails to do so in a meaningful way. The script is full of cliches, and the dialogue is often wooden and uninspired. The performances by the lead actors are mediocre at best, with the characters feeling one-dimensional and underdeveloped. The special effects in the film are underwhelming, with the visual representation of the 22nd-century Earth feeling uninspired and generic. The film tries to create a sense of hopelessness and despair, but it comes across as forced and inauthentic. The film's pacing is also a problem, with the story feeling slow and uneventful for long stretches. The climax of the film is underwhelming, failing to deliver the sense of tension and excitement that it should have. Furthermore, it's worth mentioning that the film also includes elements of misandry, which is the hatred of men or boys, throughout the movie. This is especially evident in the portrayal of the male characters, who are shown as either weak or villainous, and in the way the female characters are portrayed as stronger and more capable than their male counterparts. This kind of portrayal can be seen as problematic, as it reinforces harmful stereotypes and doesn't do much to contribute to the feminist discussion. Overall, ""Jung_E"" is a forgettable and uninspired addition to the sci-fi genre. The film fails to deliver on its ambitious concept and leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. The film's lack of originality, poor pacing, uninspired performances and the inclusion of misandry make it difficult to recommend to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for an engaging and thought-provoking film. The movie industry is over saturated with post-apocalyptic and dystopian movies that most of them are very similar and have the same themes and ideas. ""Jung_E"" unfortunately, falls into that category, it fails to bring anything new to the table and it feels like a cheap rip off of other successful movies in the genre. In conclusion, ""Jung_E"" is a film that fails to deliver on its ambitious concept and leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. The film's lack of originality, poor pacing, uninspired performances and the inclusion of misandry make it difficult to recommend to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for an engaging and thought-provoking film. The movie industry is over-saturated with post-apocalyptic and dystopian movies, and ""Jung_E"" unfortunately adds nothing new to the genre.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The movie starts of well and has gripping action from the start, the action sequences are some of the most exciting and edge of your seat combat with some cool ethical theorys as well as the morality of ai consciousness but it's structured very poorly. The exposition is thick and fast leaving you little time to really let sink in what has just been said. The action is also condensed into 3 or 4 blocks that while great, serve as little reward for the exposition you sit through to get to that point. While the ideas explored inside are definitely interesting and a great movie could be built on their premise the movie get slightly lost in itself with the amount of detail pushed into what is ultimately quite a short movie. It's a good watch when you can find nothing else but I would say it is a fall back on, rather than searching out.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The film started of with some good action, then it falls of the track.. VFX, CGI are good but not awesome. Story is very predictable and the screenplay was not engaging and it was slow, the duration of the movie is less, but I felt it like 2hrs 15minutes, so it's not enough to hold me up throughout. Only 2 action sequences in the whole movie, they made well but the VFX could have been made better... Overall, you can watch this movie with 0% expectations, don't get hyped by seeing the film's trailer cut, if you are too bored, if there are no other movies in your pocket you can watch this...!!!",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"After watching the trailer, I was expecting it to be an action sci-fi, it has intense robot actions but most of the part it's about the daughter's bond/relationship with her mother. The wide-shot dystopian scenes are just beautiful, the structure of the world really looks amazing, especially the climax scenes. 25% of first half kind of feels boring but if you are able to feel the (heavy) emotions of the character at the end of second act without losing concentration, then all your patience of first half is paid off. Because story takes its own time to build the depth of the characters and the situation. The concept of the story is definitely made only for Sci-fi nerds, especially if you had watched the Westworld series. And the climax battle is short but dayhm awesome, you will get the vibe of movies from ""I, Robot"" (for robot actions) and ""Terminator"" (for robot design). The second half of this movie is really a highlight, from action to Sci-fi VFX. If you like watching drama and sci-fi stories, then it is made for you.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"So JUNG_E has some very exciting action and some great visuals, a great lead performance from Kang Soo-yeon, (Rest in peace). The film is clearly taking inspiration from other Si-Fi futuristic movies such as Blade Runner, Blade Runner 2049, and I Robot. So the inspiration shown is very interesting to see but the film doesn't live up to those expectations at all as the story is pretty forgettable and feels like we've seen the film a hundred times before. There's also some annoying characters here such as the director played by Ryu Kyung-soo. So cool action and visuals but forgettable story 5/10.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"First off, I knew nothing about this film, and I didn't know that the female lead had died in real life. It came up on my Netflix queue, the premise looked interesting, so I watched. And I am glad I did. People bashing this movie have obviously been raised on a steady diet of big-budget action movies where there are explosions every few seconds. If not, they lose interest. This movie, while it has its action, is more a character study and a dive into the morality of cyber-human symbiosis. I found the acting top notch. Even the quirky out of place odd behaviors are there for a purpose...to demonstrate how machines and organics react differently to external stimuli. By the end I found myself thinking...""What if""...this was to happen? And that's the mark of a compelling and thoughtful movie. 8.5 stars.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"People are giving low scores because they are going in with the wrong expectations. If you are looking for a popcorn movie that is action packed from start to finish then this is not the movie for you. This movie is more about ethical questions of cloning, treatment of clones, as well as the emotional bound between a daughter and a mother. The action, futuristic world is just a back drop to tell this story. And it is a very touching story where the main character gave a great performance on a subject that I can somewhat relate to. I would say this is more a drama rather than action film, although I did also enjoyed the action and CGI. The movie is great, but the trailer is horrible. It really gave people the wrong impression.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Stumbling upon the 2023 South Korean action sci-fi movie ""Jung_E"" on Netflix, of course I had to watch it. I had never actually heard about the movie prior to sitting down to watch it, so I didn't really have any expectations to the movie. And truth be told, I am not particularly a huge sci-fi fan, so I can't claim that I was particularly thrilled to sit down to watch this movie from writer and director Sang-Ho Yeon. But of course ""Jung_E"" deserved a fair chance, and thus I opted to watch it. ""Jung_E"" certainly was a visually impressive movie, and I must admit that I was definitely enjoying the special effects and CGI in the movie. It looked and felt like a futuristic movie, without a doubt. And the special effects in the movie certainly does a lot to lift up and carry the movie. As for the story and script in ""Jung_E"", as written by Sang-Ho Yeon, well I wasn't overly impressed and was actually only mildly entertained by the storyline here. It was simplistic and generic, and there wasn't really much food for thought as the storyline trotted on for 98 minutes. Sure, it was watchable and fair enough for what it was, but this was by no means a groundbreaking sci-fi tale. They had a good cast ensemble in the movie, just a shame that the actors and actresses were somewhat held back by a bland script. I am sure that diehard sci-fi fans will get a much greater kick out of watching ""Jung_E"" than I did as a mere casual viewer. My rating of ""Jung_E"" lands of a five out of ten stars.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"A heartfelt tale about a daughter's quest to free her mother: it certainly has flaws, but overall, it was done very well. The acting, the portrayal of limitless corporate greed, and the subsequent dehumanization which does not end even as human beings hang on to their last vestiges were dealt with well. The problem was when those themes were not fleshed out properly but rather embedded in the plot. I disagree with the negative reviews saying there were not enough action scenes blah blah blah. I guess folks with that type of complaints have probably never watched anything aside from Michael Bay's transformers movies. The ending is the reason I will not rate it higher. I felt the ending was not quite cathartic enough. It just did not hit the same way and felt like there is more story to be told which as a movie - whether there is a planned sequel or not- should not be the norm.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Ok, whatever you are looking for this film does not deliver. Drama? NO...thrills? NO...suspense? NO... so what is going on here? Good question. Futuristic research lab gets data from a female mercenary's mind. Then it begins... a sad plodding of... of... of...nothingness achieving nothing. No idea where anything connects to anything else. No plot arcs beyond brain in army cyborg. Zero character development, but still annoying characters. No progression of each scene beyond more grumbling and scenes of apocalypse from the train trip. So, go ahead and enjoy a quart of Korean whiskey put on your slippers and try not to shoot yourself in the head. Ugh...",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I guess if you made the near-masterpiece Train to Busan, they'll let you make just about anything. Jung_E is a film that kind of baffles me. It's got some very committed performances, imaginative and intriguing world building, and impressive production design (although the CGI is often terrible). But it wastes its golden ideas on a story that has no idea what it wants to say or even what it wants to focus on. There are spurts of thought-provoking material throughout the movie, where characters discuss and contemplate the distinct value of human priorities and compassion that can never be understood by practical machines. It's got nothing new to say, but at least there is some attempt at emotional weight and philosophical themes. Sadly, though, the vast majority of this movie meanders all over the place with no purpose in mind. The first 15 minutes gives us clunky exposition about a war in space that we never see and never get any insight into. Then we're introduced to the main character who is trying to develop combat AI based on her mother's brain. We never get to know why she cares about this or why this is the best way for her side to win the war, or even why they should win the war. What is this? Why should we care? The script takes for granted that because she is the main character, we should be invested in what she's doing. But the story never once takes the time to let us know who she is, what's important to her, or even what's at stake in the conflict. In fact, there really isn't any conflict. The whole plot consists of these scientists running tests on a combat AI. That's basically it. Then the final 30 minutes gives us a rushed climax where we still don't know what our protagonist's goals are, and when she finally tells us what her goal was, it seems to spit in the face of everything she learned as a character over the course of the movie. I have no idea how this got green lit with this screenplay. It's sloppy at best, and insultingly idiotic self-indulgent at worst. It thinks it's so much smarter than it is, while having nothing noteworthy to say. It's characters are so wildly inconsistent in their goals and behaviours that it's hard to believe it was written by one guy (which it was). And it's even harder to believe that this is the same filmmaker who made Train to Busan.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The story concept is not all that original but still an interesting watch. One thing that I do not understand is why does a battle robot have to be based on a male or female body type? Is this feminism in action? The dumb battlebots are ""male"" with male type voices while the superior battle-bot is female. Why does a battlebot need a curvy set of breasts and bottoms? Absurd feminist-superiority in action. Why does a battlebot have to be humanoid in structure? It is dumb to put the brain in a ""head"" that is an easy target. Why not put the brain in the chest with a ""head"" full of sensors? Why have only two arms when three can be better. Why does the idiot product developer need to be a ""male""?

IMDb,False,"Yeon Sang-ho is director and writer in this futuristic tale about a legendary mercenary Captain Yun Jung-yi
(Kim Hyun-joo) who leads the revolt with Allied Forces against the Adrian Republic, after attacking Earth
and man-made shelters in outer-space,
in the not-too-distant future. During her final mission,
Captain Yun Jung-yi is left in a comatose state whilst her family is approached by the research institute Kronoid with a proposition to have her brain cloned. In order to develop an AI mercenary code-named JUNG_E who will finally lead the Allied Forces to victory. Kang Soo-yeon in her final film appearance, may she rest in peace. Delivers an emotional portrayal as the daughter of the war-hero, Yun Seo-hyun, who became team leader of the research project and works diligently towards upholding her mother's legacy. I believe that keeping the honor of our ancestors was the overall message of the film, but it did become somewhat muddled in an otherwise decent premise. The storyline feels incomplete or it could have been a pilot for a sitcom. The saving grace for the film was the action sequences with Kim Hyun-joo that were exceptional and well-choreographed. Especially during the opening scene. The team behind the visual effects completely outdid themselves as this is one of the most visually remarkable films that I have ever seen from a Korean release. I can see them receiving numerous accolades for the outstanding detail on the landscapes of an Earth that has become desolate and uninhabitable through climate-change. However, the runtime was too short for a concept this ambitious. The mother-daughter relationship was the primary focus, but I also wanted the narrative to go into further detail about the fate of this futuristic society. The world-building and the characterization should have been more fleshed out as it merely felt cold and empty. The viewer is only left creatively malnourished during the closing act.

The visuals are fantastic. The CGI is convincing. The acting is solid. The storyline is bittersweet and, in some ways, unusual. This is a far-future robot AI sci-fi that has the love between a daughter and her mother at it's core, with no romance (refreshing!). Yes, there are some plot holes. For example, why are they working so hard to make a combat AI robot who keeps failing in simulation when the police AI that society already possesses is so advanced? Still, it doesn't deserve such atrocious reviews and I hope you won't let yourself be put off from trying it.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Still, the Korean and the Chinese appear to be the only that have the courage to make a superfuturistic sci-fi with a serious budget. The directing is naive and sloppy from time time, and acting even worse by some actors (not all of them) especially if you are not used to asian acting which very different from western or european acting. The last 25 minutes or so are hard-core metal to metal fights, cracking and sparking fun with top-class CGI and motion capture. It is worth the watch, even if you skip the boring parts, the last third of the movie is very good action and some good robot design.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"The first 10 minutes or so has great robot fighting, with a cool tank-dog thrown in. However, it becomes boring after this. It becomes a drama and we get more background info on the chick's mother (the robot warrior) with a bunch of talking and stuff. They screwed up here. This movie would have been way better if they focused more on the robot warrior. We could have witnesses her growth as they tinkered with her, making her the bad-ass killing machine they wanted. From here they could have gone two ways. She could have turned on them or they could have put her in the field and we watch her kick ass until she has a sad death. Or some combination of the two. Instead we get a boring back story about her mother and drama for the next hour or so. And what's with the wierd over-acting at times, especially by the director guy. At times he starts yelling real loud or screams his lines. I'm not sure if he was trying to ""act"", but he just looked stupid. Anyways, this movie wasted a great idea, and could have been so much more, but ended up being a dud. It's watchable, but barely. As you watch the movie, you can see how this could have been SO much more than it was.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Overall, ""Jung_E"" is a disappointment for fans of director Yeon Sang-ho's previous work, ""Train to Busan."" While the film boasts impressive action set-pieces and some thought-provoking ethical dilemmas, it ultimately falls short in its execution. The plot, which centers around a team of experts attempting to upload a soldier's consciousness into an AI machine, feels bloated and overlong, with too much time spent on repeated conversations rather than exploring the themes and ideas the film presents. The acting is solid, with standout performances from the late Kang Soo-yeon and Ryu Kyung-soo, but the direction feels confused and disjointed, as if Yeon couldn't quite figure out how to balance the action and philosophical elements of the film. In the end, ""Jung_E"" feels like a missed opportunity, with a lot of potential but not enough substance to make it a truly satisfying film. It's a shame, as Yeon's skill with set-pieces and action filmmaking is undeniable, but it's clear that he struggled to find a way to make this project work.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern

RottenTomatoes,False,"Jung_E is a strange mix of sci-fi ambition and slow-paced storytelling that doesn’t quite hit the mark but still has some impressive elements. The pacing feels off, with long, drawn-out scenes that could have been used to deepen the story instead of stretching it thin. However, the CGI is surprisingly well done, better than what you’d expect even from high-budget Hollywood productions. Visually, the film is solid, but its world-building lacks the depth needed to make the story feel immersive. The acting is decent but not outstanding, and the script doesn’t give the characters much room to shine.

The concept is interesting but somewhat confusing in execution, especially in how it handles the idea of AI and consciousness. It feels like the movie wants to explore deeper themes but never fully commits, leaving things feeling underdeveloped. The action sequences, when they happen, are well done, but the film leans more into its tech-heavy, philosophical side rather than delivering a consistently engaging plot. While it’s not a bad movie, it’s also not one that leaves a lasting impact. Worth a watch if you appreciate good CGI and a unique take on AI, but don’t expect it to be a game-changer.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
RottenTomatoes,False,"Movie started off good and intriguing, but started to drift a bit off to boringness, where some parts were too long for unnecessary reasons. They could have even wrapped this movie up as a short movie (you know, the short sci-fi movies you see on Youtube). So yeah, a bit too long. We get it, we get it, skip skip skip. But what really challenged the audiences intelligence was that they ran the same simulation over and over and over again. You would think after many years, if not decades, they would have accomplished the simulation pattern. Unless they weren't able to think outside of the box... which I doubt if they were smart enough to make AI robots fight like bruce lee. There was just something not right about this sci-fi movie. I guess they tried to spin an ""I Robot"" alternative. Not a movie that will stick in your memory for years, and I guess it's just okay to watch.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
RottenTomatoes,False,"I absolutely hate this movie, it is surprisingly well made and got me extremely emotional because of how good it was. How it depicted a copy of human mind in androids made me mildly uncomfortable because of how realistic the whole process was (specifically how they treated them, not made them). A person dying and having their consciousness copied and used for production by companies? Yea that checks out. And how throughout the movie it constantly makes you question if each copy is just a robot or if there really is some sort of soul of the original person in there somewhere. 

I just wanted to play a semi interesting ScyFy movie in the background while I work on a project, but ended up getting fully intrigued and invested. Again, I hate this movie. It made me feel things I did not want and was not ready to feel.

I think the presence of the Chairman was wasted and could have been stronger. The music is almost invisible. Sounds effects are decent. I give it 70%. A decent movie that doesn't explore it's theme of immortality versus robots enough, but a good piece of scifi. This movie is an homage to Kang Soo-youn who passed away in 2022.",JUNG_E,2023,Eastern
RottenTomatoes,False,"Jung_E is Far from a masterpiece, but he's definitely not a disaster The movie will pull out occasional emotional beats that for the most part kind of work, jung_E feels mostly like they could expand on a bigger story through more time and storytelling, but sales for a quick 1h39m movie that feels a little empty The very last shot in the film is just something I have to bring up because it really does look beautiful. The movie will have its moments where it can look really good then there's others where it looks a little more like a video game so this movie is odd not my least favorite, film of 2023 but just pretty meh i'd recommend it if you're in the mood for some sci fi but other than that you could probably pass this and not this much 3/10 also, this is the same guy who directed one of my favorite zombie movies ever train to Busan.

IMDb,False,"I haven't read the manga this is based on, but I HAVE seen the anime of it which was one of my favourites in the past few years and while the plot in this movie adaptation is very sped up, it is extremely well done! The story is cohesive enough even though plot points had to be edited and the special effects are superb considering what they COULD have been... beat the socks off San Andreas which was nothing BUT one long CGI sequence. Hollywood, take note... sometimes less IS more. I can understand people who are new or haven't been exposed to the story possibly having a tough time 'getting it', but there really is enough to hang a story on... even with a giant chunk missing here and there. As for the detractors going on about how the original has been butchered, give it a rest would ya?? The anime clocked in at somewhere near 9 hours in it's entirety and yes, it was condensed from the manga, but what the heck do you need to be satisfied with a movie adaptation? Five to six full length movies? a few 3 hour movies?? get real here... there's an old saying that goes 'A movies length should be no longer than the average viewer's bladder capacity'. Get off your fandom, 'purist' snotty attitudes and accept it for what it is... a wholly ORIGINAL and satisfying experience that Hollywood could do FAR worse to emulate!",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I loved Hitoshi Iwaaki's manga and I loved the anime just as much, so after hearing about a Parasyte live action, I got curious and decided to see if it would turn out bad or good. I wasn't disappointed, the story did progress a bit fast for my tastes but not to fast to make me dislike it. The creators really didn't hold back on gore in this movie, everything was clear and visible, from insides to cut open heads. The CGI wasn't bad either. the way the heads morphed into the blades and eyes looked pretty realistic. I was happy that quite a few original characters were kept in this movie, but I wished it did follow the manga a little more, but it did keep some important points. Overall, it wasn't a bad adaptation, they cut the movie off at a really good part that makes you want a sequel in which I'll be looking forward to.",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I'm personally an anime watcher of Parasyte, so I obviously don't know about the greatness of the manga, just a disclaimer. I personally found the gore of this movie to be extremely unsettling, it's not even censored like the anime and they even try hard to feed you as much gore as possible, making the series 80% darker than it is presented in the anime. As an anime watcher, I felt uncomfortable by the way they shifted the scenes around and certain changes, but I guess it is necessary to do so to fit as much as they can into the movie. My friend who has yet to dive into this series found the story plot good, so I guess it can pass as a smooth story plot for a movie. Finally, I must really praise the CGI and sound effects used, simply spectacular. In my opinion, I would recommend watching the anime series as there is more time for slower and steadier character development, especially for Shinichi, the main character, that we can appreciate, and the gore factor is not above the roof; but just watch it and experience it for yourself. :)",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Apparently, this story was a comic and an ""anime"", so I'm surprised fan-boys aren't out baying for the director's blood after he ""destroyed/ruined/raped"" their favourite cartoon with a live-action version. Which is usually the case. For those like myself, who had no idea of Parasyte's roots, it's easy to sit back and enjoy a film that's very off-kilter, and unmistakably Japanese. So, what's it all about? One night, some ugly crawling creatures float down from... outer space? I don't know, it's never mentioned nor does it ever need to be, but these creatures eat a person's brain and take over the body, with the head then going Resident Evil-style psychotic to feed on other humans. One boy falls asleep listening to music and the parasite somehow enters his hand instead, taking over just that part of his body, thus leaving him relatively intact. As the other infested bodies go about wreaking havoc, our teen with the alien hand soon finds himself up against them, and so the adventure beings. Aimed at teenagers, the gore level and dark undertones are surprising, but add a great deal of depth to what is ultimately a boy strolling around with a talking, morphing, glove puppet. Overall though, the characters deliver, the stakes escalate and it ends just itching for a sequel, which I'm led to believe has already been completed. If you can get past the first half an hour with the cute alien hand talking and curiously studying the world, you'll most likely go on to really get into this and will enjoy it a great deal for your effort; if you can't stand the idea of watching CGI monster fights against a puppet and find the whole concept too ridiculous to bear, then there's not much point even putting it on to begin with. Personally, I'd definitely recommend this film.",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Despite advocating for the harmonious co-existence between races (a theme that crops up in conversation too many times to be coincidence), Parasyte is a testament to human selfishness, with many characters pursuing their own desires, without thinking of other people, or the potential consequences. Though friends of mine see me as an 'anime addict' my lacking knowledge of the anime this feature is based upon, did not infringe upon my experience. The beginning of the film sees multiple parasitic organisms finding their way into human society, though their origins remain unexplored. Invading the bodies of potential hosts, the parasites completely take over, and despite having an obscene appetite for human flesh, they also exhibit a dire craving for knowledge, with stereotypical plans for world domination. Imagine a combination of Slither and Supernatural Season Seven, and you're on the right track. Though infected humans like Ryoko (Eri Fukatsu) have an open mind, and attempt to find a way to coexist amongst the human populace, most of her kind do not share such peaceful agendas. Shinichi (Shota Sometani) is a high-school student, with nerdy hobbies and few friends, though his character's life before the film is rarely touched upon. During the first scene in which we are introduced to his character, a parasitic organism invades his body, taking control of his arm. Later referred to as Migi (voiced by Sadao Abe), the creature quickly acquires great intellect, and knowledge of its surroundings, despite the predicament that it was meant to seize control of Shinichi's brain. Regardless of his situation, Shinichi is seldom seen as a sympathetic character, a certain degree of humor transpiring in regards to both his nightmarish experience, and the banter that takes place between him and Migi. That being said, his mother (Nobuko Izumi), and love interest Satomi (Ai Hashimoto) are certainly depicted sympathetically, though neither of them is ever provided significant screen time to be truly memorable. Shota's mother is allocated some degree of backstory, and Ms. Izumi's talents heighten her character's motherly affections. Satomi on the other hand, is depicted as either the damsel in distress, or as an object of copulation, and is rarely treated as a mature, young woman. Other characters, including Detectives Hirama (Jun Kunimura) and Tsuji (Takashi Yamanaka) provide the viewer with information necessary to the plot, though seldom is it explained how they themselves acquired such knowledge, while characters including Goto (Tadanobu Asano) and Yamagishi (Kosuke Toyohara) appear in cameo roles, presumably with the intent to have them portray larger roles in the sequel. Much like The Thing, a film which would make any viewer paranoid about their surroundings, Parasyte is a film that will occasionally leave you wriggling in your chair at the sight of such violence. Although blood-thirsty, what is most disturbing is watching such disgusting creatures eating human flesh. This is accentuated by the effects, which are truly superb, the creatures looking incredibly imaginative, unique and realistic. Upon discovery that those around him are being taken over, Shinichi and Migi form an unlikely alliance to combat the villainous creatures. Although Parasyte is unafraid to have characters experience great tragedy, at the same time, the film is very predictable, even for someone who hasn't seen the anime, and though the acting cannot be faulted, the melodrama did take away from some of the experience. This being said, Parasyte provides the viewer with an original experience, which is as tense as it is entertaining, though lacking information and an anti-climatic finish, may leave question marks bobbing above your head.",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern
IMDb,False,"To be honest I never read the Japanese comic book version before but now, I think I should start reading one. Even though Parasyte Part 1 seems to have some unsettling moments going on, but at the end it all wraps up really well from its thoughtful and amusingly entertaining storytelling. All the actors here did their roles really well thanks to the script that leaves room for character development resulting in an effectively touching moment in the last act. The effects in the film is also impressive in an Asian film level and it gets really bloody, GORY, and disturbing throughout as well. I may not be able to compare it to the comic since I never read it but overall here, Parasyte Part 1 is an accomplishment in entertainment value while being able to add in thoughtful social context and creating a character where audience can actually care about. It's a film that you can be fully satisfy once the credit rolls but still make you crave for more sequel. >>A-<<",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern

The acting is excellent and the story is just bizarre, weird, strange, outlandish; so many words that can describe its crazy idea but it works - a man with what looks like a speaking male sex toy as his left hand with a human eye on it, not only was it bizarre it was hilarious and yet the extremely gruesome violence in the movie was total incongruous to the humorous side of the story.

IMDb,False,"Alright, well aside from this being a Japanese movie and having a fairly interesting title, then I knew nothing about the movie, nor that it was based on a Manga. But my love for Asian cinema drove me to watch this 2014 movie when I was given the chance in 2019. I must admit that I can't really claim to be much of a fan of ""Parasyte - Part 1"" (aka ""Kiseijuu""), because I found the movie to have a rather mundane and slow-paced storyline, with director Takashi Yamazaki at the steering wheel and not really doing much of anything impressive. Story-wise then ""Parasyte - Part 1"" was mundane, and I must admit that I actually dozed off twice along the process of the prolonged movie. Yeah, the story failed to really captivate me. So why did I continue to watch it to the very end? Well, for two reasons. The first reason because because I also have ""Parasyte - Part 2"" lined up, so I manned up and stuck with the ordeal that was the first part of the movie series. But the second and most important reason for why I stuck with it was the special effects. Granted, the creature designs were ludicrous and quite far out there, but the CGI effects were quite dazzling. In fact, I will say that the CGI team made the movie watchable by the special effects alone. ""Parasyte - Part 1"" is hardly a major milestone in Japanese cinema, and it was a movie that came without finding its way on my radar, and now that I have seen the first part, I doubt that I will ever be visiting a second time around. The movie just failed to bring much of anything worthwhile to the screen for me. This was a difficult movie to suffer through, because the storyline was atrocious and it was quite slow paced. Essentially it was the CGI special effects that salvaged the movie for me and the majority of the reason why I am rating ""Parasyte - Part 1"" a gracious four out of ten stars, whereas without the CGI special effects the movie would have been given a lower rating from me. A movie such as this might hold a greater appeal if you are a Japanese teenager with a life revolving around reading Mangas.",Parasyte: Part 1,2014,Eastern

There was no journey and no change- (could have been the script and a one dimensional actor). Why didn't the actor wear glasses at the start and then loose them later when he got some of the parasytes cells. Why didn't they choose an actor with straight hair, who could look ""nerdy"" initially and then become convincing as a cold calculating human. (4) the over explanation of concepts. etc etc It's terrible, don't see it.I can't believe the overall ranking is 7.1.

They are also some really unique looking effects in this and the movie features some gruesome creatures. On the other hand some of the effects looked really terrible and the CGI was really bad at times. The movie balanced somewhere between some pretty good and gnarly looking effects and the almost childish and comically bad looking CGI.

To me, the greatest character was Ryôko Tamiya, and the actress was also quite good. At first I thought that she was doing the stone faced alien thing too much, but after a while I realized that it was the right way to play it. I wish Shôta Sometani would have put in more of an effort as the lead character, but he was sufficient as it was. The Migi character was well done, maybe a little too nice. Overall, the movie presents an interesting idea, which combines body horror sci-fi with a critique on current society. Well done, as direction and special effects go, acting, too.

IMDb,False,"I've been a fan of the original manga for this story (at least the 2 American editions I know of) for a long time. It caught my attention at once, and was imaginative, surprising, and interesting. Once I'd read that the rights had been bought by an American company I wondered how they'd be able to condense this long story into a single movie. The rights expired, and Parasyte was made into 2 movies in Japan, and also an anime series. After seeing this film, I was disappointed. A problem is that all the elements that made the original so interesting could not possibly fit into a single film (or even 2 of them). A lot of changes had to be made, and characters and plot events had to be merged or deleted. I was able to watch what remained partly because I'd liked the original so much, and also because some of the visuals and segments in the film *were* worth watching. I thought the effects showing Migi and the various Parasyte battles were handled well-and that could have easily come out badly. I watched this off a region 3 DVD, with English subtitles and Japanese soundtrack, on a widescreen TV-so presentation of the film wasn't the issue. In my opinion, the only way to effectively present Parasyte as film would be as a serial. This has been done in anime form, and the product is much more enjoyable. I do intend to watch the second part of the live-action film as soon as it's available on DVD, mostly because I've seen Part 1, and I want to see how it ends.

As expected, this is really just a promotion for selling 2 (hopefully it won't be a trilogy) films instead of 1. I don't know why anyone would bother when it would be much more worth the time and money to see an enhanced version of the original cartoon on a theater screen. For many people, that's not really necessary because home theater systems give you the benefits of the theater and you can watch each episode rather than a selectively truncated/revised encapsulation of the series. As for the sci-fi and story involved, it's the same as the cartoon, which is interesting but far from absolutely necessary to watch. Even the series is no better than a 5 of 10.

Brilliant direction, omitted 99% of the clichés in the zombie movies. Absolutely brilliant action, graphics, the performances of the junior artists (Zombies) makes this movie a beautiful, engaging horror thriller. This movie has got the comedy, action, thrills, emotional quotients and mesmerizing acting by the lead actors. The music and background score was absolutely brilliant. A gem added to the zombie list. Don't miss this.. My rating 8.2 on 10",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"If you are a big zombie film fan, this should be your next flick to check it out. This is a Japanese live-action film adapted from the manga series of the same name. I am not saying it was the best zombie film ever, or the decade or even the year, but surely a better film compared to the recent ones. First of all the story is same as most of the same themed films, that the zombie outbreak brings chaos everywhere, and followed by the survival game. The difference in here was the characters and some of the great scenes that lifted the film up. Hideo, also pronounced as Hero is a 'best newcomer' manga artist award winner a few years back. Now in his 30s looking for a breakthrough in his career. But after receiving a backlash when his book was denied to publish and followed by break up with his girlfriend, he begins to witness a series of strange events around him. While the entire city turned into madness, he and a random school girl join the hands to escape from the horror. So their journey begins to nowhere, but be safe. Later a couple of twists come into play and brings an end to the narration. The script was not praiseworthy, but the filmmaking was, including the performances. The actors had given their best shots. The scenes involving the conflict between humans and zombies were carved so awesomely. Being a film fanatic, I'm used to this kind of themes, so none of these flicks can scare me. Not just the sci-fi horror films, but also the supernatural horrors. That's a drawback. But if I was a normal guy or a little kid, this film would have been in a different league. Still, I enjoyed it. Because overall film offered me a great entertainment. ""What you seek isn't dream anymore! It's delusion. Only a small, special group of people can achieve success."" I don't understand the Japanese, except a few simple words, but from my observation, they never mentioned the word 'zombie'. They called it by the virus that caused it, ZQN. I don't know what those alphabets stand for, but all I got was the word 'Zokyun'. The equivalent English word is 'bang', like a sudden sharp thud sound. Anyway, coming to the film, the characters are unpredictable. You can't trust anyone of them, except our lead guy. Not just because of the infection, but their intentions, more like it is about survival of the fittest. I mean like usual, the man's weakness, power hungry. After Hideo, the school girl Hiromi is the next in the lead, but there's nothing much to expect from her. They kept that role very mysterious, that I was looking for an explanation which never came. That was really disappointing, but it also mean a hint of a possible sequel. I hope they make one, after all this film was received so well. The details in the film were very impressive, even the small ones. Not just they focused the human characters, they have given strength to zombies to strike the survived human ruthlessly, but uniquely like an athlete. So basically, no traditional zombie theory was followed. They bent the rules to make it a unique product, as well as to entertain the viewers, mostly funnily. Shot in the fine places, especially in the second half. This film redefined the zombie film from those days before the evolution of superheroes and space-age flicks. It was a perfect mix of comedy, action and thriller. But I laughed surely better than those recent full length comedy flicks that had best comedians. This is not a remake material, so I'm not expecting the west to do that. Like I always say, whatever world film I watch, I'm happy to end up in a Japanese or a French film. It was a bit long, worth it though. I am not overwhelmed and blindly recommending it, but this film was really good, particularly if you like black comedy, sort of. 7/10",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"For so long we only have English zombies and Chinese zombies, then this year we got our first Korean zombies and now we welcome the first appearance of Japanese zombies. The zombie apocalypse genre is excessively tried and tired. How Japan, having some of the most crowded cities in the world, hasn't gotten into the act is one mystifying mystery. Shinsuke Sato, adapting Kengo Hanazawa's massively popular manga of the same name, understands the source material and totally transpose the addictive page-turning frenzy onto the cinematic medium. This is one crackerjack of a movie and if you have to force me to make decision, I would choose to watch this again over Train to Busan. Hideo Suzuki (Yô Ôizumi) is a manga artist still twiddling along long after his sell-by date. He lives with his wife who is tired of waiting for Hideo to score his first success at serialising his comic. Every night Hideo draws and stares at his self-made post-it notes of encouragement - ""you rock"" and ""one day a street will be named after you"". If that doesn't work, he will take out his shotgun for skeet shooting and pose in front of a full length mirror. He only stops short at muttering the infamous words of Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver. One night he is thrown out of the house and all hell breaks loose. Together with the quintessential school girl (Kasumi Arimura) in short skirt, they go on to Mt Fuji for safety because they read in one urgent posting on the internet - zombies can't survive in high altitude. The moment the zombie epidemic starts, I am a Hero careens into one giddy blood- soaked adrenaline rush. The film doesn't push the zombie genre to new directions, but it takes the established tropes and gives it a fresh twist and out comes one sicko and satisfying monster-tainer. I love the opening establishing and main character building scenes - Hideo represents the typical male gazer, your favourite type of loser. His name notwithstanding, you know you will be watching an extreme character arc of a loser becoming a hero. How many times have you seen that in a zombie film? He is a pacifist in a cutthroat world of running zombies. How long can he stay that way in this world? Pretty long, I have to say. When the heroic moment finally arrives, and he steps up to the plate, a big smile was plastered on my face. How else did the movie remixed the zombie tropes? Imagine zombies moving and gesticulating in Sadako (Ringu) style; zombies retaining one memory from their lifetime or a muscle memory that they repeat and repeat till someone blasts their brains out. I had a good laugh at one zombie muttering he is a taxi-driver who has won many awards for never being involved in any accident and for being the most courteous driver, and of course you know what happens next. The dark humour is just awesome. Some of them skewers the working class system and I couldn't stop myself from laughing at the absurdity of it all. In fact, I think I was the first one who started giggling. Then my wife caught the cue. Before long the audience in my section was laughing away. The dark humour was spot-on perfect and it works because you recognise the plight of the working class. The visual effects are stellar - blackening veins, clouding eye-balls and gristly cracking noises. They move and contort like crabs and insects, which gave me the creeps. This is zombies J-pop horror style. The mass chaos on the city streets is superbly shot. Imagine people coming from all directions and you are not sure who are the infected until they get nearer. One particular action sequence on a highway is an adrenaline rush. The middle act slows down a fair bit as Hideo and the girl reach a duty free mall at the foot of Mt Fuji. I am guessing that some of you who are true zombie aficionados would at this point cry ""George Romero's Dawn of the Dead"" - my respect to you if you did. But watch how the film puts a Lord of the Flies twist to it and this act comes up smelling like roses. I also love how Hideo's gun serves as a metaphor of his evolvement from zero to hero. The film's narrative may feel familiar and a little long, but it is still one helluva inventive monster ride and Hideo is a wonderfully drawn character that will slowly but surely capture your imagination. The movie shamelessly sets itself up for a sequel but I can tell you I am so looking forward to another gore fest.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"For the past few months, I have been hearing praises for ""Train to Busan"", South Korea's contribution to the zombie/undead genre. After watching it, I was left unimpressed, as it was a bit too tame for my personal tastes. I sought something more graphic, gory, and indicative of a more adult take on the genre. Fast forward to two hours ago, having finished I AM A HERO, and I am still giddy with excitement. The film is impressive in almost every conceivable way; As a film based on a well-respected manga, I did not expect much from the movie. Usually, movies made from manga reflect a very sophomoric take on the story, to appease more ""sensitive"" audiences. This film, however, goes all out with the blood and gore, and keeps all of the useless stuff (sex, romantic interests, comedy) to a minimum. The directorial style is indicative of an understanding in how to perfectly translate manga to film, the cinematography is impressively nuanced and clear in its presentation, and the acting is superb all around. The real stand out, however, are the special effects. Every single instance of a head exploding, an arm being ripped off, and blood spewing from an open wound is handled with so much love and care, that even Hollywood films could learn a thing or two about being restrained with showcasing blood and gore, but when something is shown, it should be done with this much knowledge and skill in the craft. I was thoroughly engrossed with how the story transpired, and I was happy with the lack of romantic interest in favor of creating a story about an ordinary guy thrust into a very extraordinary situation. For anyone with a more discerning horror/action/comedy palette, give this film a watch. I guarantee that it will satisfy even the most ardent of gore hound, while still appeasing the average movie fan. Overall, the best Japanese film (outside of anime) I have seen all year. I offer a very enthusiastic recommendation.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Struggling manga artist Hideo Suzuki (Yô Ôizumi) finds himself fighting for survival during a zombie outbreak. For those who felt that Korean zombie flick Train to Busan was just a little too tame when it came to the blood and guts, here is another recent Asian zombie film (this one hailing from Japan) that should more than satisfy any viewer's blood-lust. The middle third might be a tad dry, as protagonist Hideo and schoolgirl Hiromi (Kasumi Arimura) attempt to integrate with a group of survivors at a shopping outlet, but the rest of the film is gloriously gory, the finale in particular featuring more exploding heads than I could keep track of, the titular hero more than proving his worth with a shotgun. However, it's not just the gore that makes this one so much fun The basic structure of I Am A Hero is much like any other regular zombie film: first there is the chaotic outbreak, then there is the desperate struggle for survival, and finally the all-out onslaught of the undead as barriers fall and the zombies wreak havoc. But the familiarity of the basic set-up matters not: director Shinsuke Sato keeps things moving along at a cracking pace, the cast is perfect, and the editing stylish without being too showy. The zombies are also very memorable, looking suitable yucky with their cloudy eyes and nasty complexion, and repeatedly speaking phrases that they would have said before death. CGI is used for much of the carnage, but it's good CGI, which makes all the difference. Like Train to Busan, the film is perhaps a little longer than necessary, but even at just over two hours, I highly recommend I Am A Hero to fans of the genre. This is one of the good ones! 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"I saw this movie at the Stockholm International Filmfest. today and I really enjoyed it. If I had to sum it up in a brief sentence i'd say it's as if the guy who wrote the ""The Walking Dead"" comic had written a Shaun of the Dead comic, and they made a movie out of that (I haven't read the manga this film is based on, but I assume that's more or less what it is). It looks pretty expensive and has good effects and action, it's very well directed and acted, making the aesthetic of the film really paint its own manga-inspired universe. The parts I didn't like is whenever it attempts to do somewhat serious drama, when it does it just seems entirely tone-deaf and alien. I'd give this movie a 3/5 and if they skipped the 20% of attempted drama and replace it with more over-the-top zombie comedy/action it'd be a 4/5. I'd recommend this movie to most people and for zombie/nerd culture fans it's a must-see and likely a cult classic.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Maybe its because I've read the manga that I didn't like this movie that much, but the beginning was promising and I had hope for it but it fumbled at the middle and end. The plot deviates from the manga but its still the same thing. Hideo is still the same but Hiromi doesn't do anything for the movie, you could have removed her from the movie and nothing will have changed. In general characters lack development and its hard to get invested in them. The ending is bad, we don't really understand what will happen to the characters, in particular what is with Hiromi. Read the manga you will not regret it but the movie its just another bad Japanese live action.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"It's not a good movie. I think it will find a fan base in people who are obsessed with Japanese culture, but it's not a good product. I love zombie movies, but this one just has zombies to illustrate that the lead is useless. And he sure is! Basically all scenes that happen happen because zombies attack him. They all end with someone saving his life or him getting lucky because some random thing happens and saves his life - repeat 100 times over. There are even several scenes where just saying something to a person would have saved their life, or hero doesn't even do that. The only really proactive scene he has where he does something proactive to save the day is at the very end where he freaks out and uses his shotgun for the first time. Then uses it 100 times more in the same scene. For like 10 minutes in a row. There is maybe plot enough here for 30-40 minutes. And even then you would have to completely rewrite all the characters so that they would do something and try to achieve some goal. Any goal. Disgusting zombies running after losers for 2 hours and the losers getting randomly lucky in every scene gets boring really fast. There is no likeable character here and I'm not even sure what any of the characters in the movie really wanted. The bad guy wanted to... lead? The protagonist wanted to... use his shotgun? Not really as he didn't use it when he should have. We know he would survive anyhow just be shear luck. So it didn't matter anyhow. There are also many scenes where people just stand around and watch zombies run or walk towards them. Why all characters do this in this movie I don't know. I guess the director didn't really know what he was doing.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"""I am a Hero"" was a movie that just came out of nowhere and would have slipped past me unnoticed, if I hadn't happened to come across it by some sheer cosmic luck. And what is more impressive is that the fact that this is a zombie movie, and still it almost managed to elude me, especially since I am huge fan of everything zombiesque. This 2015 movie actually turns out to be one of the more entertaining and solid of Japanese zombie movies. Japan has a tendency of combining the zombie genre with too much comedy, which often makes for a somewhat questionable result. Or they tend to have very poor special effects, which usually makes it painful to watch on the screen. ""I am a Hero"", however, didn't fall into these traps, and that was a refreshing change of pace. The movie starts out in an adequate pace, but it quickly escalates into a much more fast paced movie and storyline, which did suit the movie quite well. As a zombie movie, it is quite important that the special effects are good and believable, and luckily ""I am a Hero"" had just that. The movie combines the traditional shambling decaying walking animated corpses with something new. But it was a nice approach and a nice angle to the genre, and as such it was a refreshing change of pace for the zombie genre. Lots of great special effects and zombie make-up. There is a good amount of action throughout the course of the movie, spiced up with some drama and just a pinch of comedy, which made for a rather enjoyable cocktail. A zombie movie must have blood and guts. There is also a good amount of blood and gore in ""I am a Hero"", which is definitely a crucial thing for a zombie movie to have. ""I am Hero"" also have some really intense scenes where the audience get their adrenaline pumping. Such scenes are, for example, the scene with the zombie in the taxi, and also the scene exiting the mall. All in all, then ""I am a Hero"" is a rather entertaining and enjoyable movie. It is a fast paced story that mixed elements from different genres quite well. And ""I am a Hero"" puts Japan solidly on the world map of zombie movies. And if you enjoy zombie movies, then you should definitely take the time to check out ""I am a Hero"", and if you enjoy Asian cinema, well then you get a double up on goodies here.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern

IMDb,False,"6.5/10 I really don't care for zombie movies, but I did enjoy Zombieland; it's great because it doesn't take itself too seriously and it has humor. This film also has some memorable comedic creepy/moments. What also makes this film unique is that Japan has a law where regular citizens can't carry guns, so circumstance makes it a lot different where zombie films that takes place in America can carry machine guns or other crazy weapons. However, the main character has an exception with a hunting shotgun. I know people are so obsessed and fascinated by zombies and watch or play zombie games religiously like a cult. I'm not really one of them, so I don't have any bias by immediately giving a zombie movie 10 stars just because it's cool seeing zombies walking around and being blown up; I really could care less about that. However, that being said, this film can compete among Hollywood zombie films. I was pretty impressed with the special effects - that's definitely the highlight of this film. Obviously, the story is straightforward. The zombies in this one is rather ridiculous borderline comical/scary/creepy. For a foreign Japanese, non-Hollywood film, the production value is pretty damn good where it almost feels like Hollywood. I noticed a lot of the staff crew/special effects were Korean names during the ending credits, so it seems to be a collaboration. Yo Oizumi is a famous guy in Japan, who plays the lead goofball nerdy character. He fit the role pretty well. Also, Kasumi Arimura, the girl he has to protect, is super cute. Probably a fun film to watch with a group of friends. I'm sure they could make a part 2: Mt. Fuji. You pay an arm and a leg to buy a Rolax... literally, it's worth that amount.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"So, let me start this off by saying that I don't do zombies. In my opinion, zombies are played out. There are so many variations and while I get that people are loving them these days, I'm just over the whole zombie thing. Secondly, I had a very vague description as to what this film was going to be about and I never saw anything about zombies. Had I seen that I would've passed it up and I would've missed out. I actually enjoyed this film. It was a little long but I can look past that. It also left me the feeling that there could easily be a sequel in the future and I hope there is because there were few ends that just weren't tied up. So, in other words, I was wanting more. It was a decent film and I know that my teenage boys are just going to love it. If you are a zombie buff you are gonna want to add this to your collection. Check it out.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Just as Ringu was a social metaphor of its times, I am a Hero stabs post 3/11 Japan, after earthquakes, tsunamis and nuclear meltdown stripped it of the comfort it took for granted and threw it out into a world where things stopped making sense. The movie follows the average near jobless modern Japanese thirty something's journey through a disheveled society deprived of the civilities his preceding generations have taken for granted where he is left with the ultimate choice to adapt or die. I am a Hero is my favorite zombie movie next to Shaun of the Dead and Zombieland!! It hacks the manga it's based on and blends it into a movie satisfyingly. A lot of character development goes through the window, but enough is left to make you imagine the rest. Half the staff is Korean whom we can thank for the superior effects, and the script is surprisingly tight for a Japanese production of this budget. Blood flows by the gallon, it has the best panic scene I've seen in any disaster movie, and the ZQN (zombies) are the scariest thing that's been put to film to date because they retain their former selves. None of the cast lets the film down. My sole complaint is an unimaginative crucial scene which feels more metaphorical than physical--removing some of the immediate threat I wished it would convey, but it is a mere skipped beat in a heart pounding sequence which still concludes with a powerful image. If you are familiar with the original work, I must tell you to stay away from the manga till you see the movie though, some of the stuff left out might be harder to swallow with a fresh memory. The movie keeps the main character's imagination, but leaves out the supernatural beyond the early ZQNs--it focuses on the early books, allowing it to stand alone as a zombie movie.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"A disillusioned manga artist finds himself in the middle of a zombie outbreak. Japanese zombies are quite something, as their eyes turn to the sides, their skin breaks into dark veins and, right before they attack you in order to bite you, they say the thing that they were most focused on in life. This makes the film both funny and tragic. A random encounter with a girl who seems just partly zombified and a group of people who try to survive in a mall force him to either die or become a hero. It was a nice movie. I liked the zombies, the characters, the acting was good and there were some interesting stories told as background to the zombie story. However, as original and interesting the various bits were, this is still a standard zombie movie, don't expect a lot more.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern

Take the original 4 Romeo movies (night, dawn, day, land) and cherry pick bits from those, throw them in a mixer and you have this film. The main character alternates between being an idiot, a dullard, and stumble-bum. I have never seen a film where the main character falls so bloody often. It's irritating and eventually got to be farcical. The other big issue was this film telegraphed every upcoming scene. If you've seen the aforementioned Romero films, then you know what was coming minutes in advance, and because of *that* this move lacked any tension whatsoever. This was hard to find in 2023, and probably with good reason. Stay away folks, unless you need a cure for insomnia.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
IMDb,False,"Personally, I'm tired of zombie-films/series now, too many bad ones has been made, it's time for something really different. Then the Japanese do what they have done so many times before: taking a genre and tweaking it, perfecting it, making it exciting again. This movie is a real gem, but I doubt one many westerners have heard of as yet. Made by popular Japanese director Shinsuke Sato, a Director of many popular Japanese films in his country to these Days, this film shares a lot of elements with 28 days later, and this is the best zombie film since. The main character is Hideo, a 30-something Manga artist out of luck, his girlfriend/wife is fed up with his lack of success. Then reports of a new virus spreads around Tokyo, making people act, at first too late, then erratically, all the time trying to calm the public and so on. And from there this great movie takes off like the opening of Pandoras Box. It's a high budget production, with great action scenes and special effects, the most scary and diverse zombies ever to hit the screen, but also with more personality than other zombies (the high-jump athlete zombie is a masterpiece only a Japanese horror mind could have come up with!). If you're one of those thinking:""Dude, I've seen like THE worst AND the best zombie death scenes there is, so, don't bother me""....You should see this one. It's a story containing both humour, warmth and great character development, not just the random slasher. It has got some very fresh plot twists and some really nasty moments. It's blended with some real tranquil sequences, and then all hell brake loose again. Made in great environments, it has a genuine Japanese cultural feel to it and excellent camera-work, making it far more interesting to watch than any other western zombie/horror film nowadays. The soundtrack is great too. If you are a horror movie fan, a zombie aficionado, or just like action movies, here you've got something far more exciting to spend time watching than another episode of the (sleep) Walking Dead, and most other horror movies right now. So, thank you Shinsuke Sato for renewing this genre and constantly showing the rest of the World what great filmmakers you Japanese are. Don't miss it, it's a no brainier!

I Am a Hero satisfies all of the typical zombie movie urges while being unique enough to feel fresh and entertaining. We follow our protagonist Hideo, a struggling manga artist as he overcomes his insecurities and ultimately becomes the hero he wrote about so many times in his stories. Along the way he meets a girl whom has been infected with the zombie virus, but is half immune to its effects... rendering her still alive and able to control herself but also giving her the special strength that comes with being infected. Once Hideo comes across a band of survivors who have built a sanctuary on the rooftops of some outdoor strip malls, he must protect his infected friend from the tyrannical leadership of said survivors. The acting is solid, the plot is interesting, the design of the infected is done extremely well with there being a large handful of unique zombies with seemingly different personalities and abilities, creating some high stakes moments that will both creep you out but also worry for the characters you've come to care for.

The ZQN can also mutate the host anatomy from simple rabid zombie to wild abominations. The manga is great as well.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern

Letterboxd,False,"Started off promising, building up this loser character nicely. Then the zombie thing began, hitting all the genre buttons. Our hero carried his gun all the way without able to fire it, and behaved like a coward, until the end.

Letterboxd,False,"Hooptober XII #3 6.5/10 Not exactly something to write home about, but I Am a Hero is still a pretty fun zombie movie. The first 30 minutes had me hooked, i was genuinely excited to see where it was going.

Letterboxd,False,"Wow, the zombie design in this one was really fascinating. It's cold and rainy so I doubled up on the edibles and was locked in from the start.

Letterboxd,False,"la verdad que me gusto esta historia,me gusto el enfoque bizarro al que llevaron los zombies combinandola con una critica social muy marcada Aunque hay un cierto personaje que termina siendo desperdiciado siento que por lo menos cumple un poco fuera de eso se me hizo super divertida y entretenida ademas de que las 2 horas de duracion que tiene se me pasaron re volando",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern
Letterboxd,False,"very good as far as manga adaptations go. but as a manga reader, i HATE how they sanitized the main character. this would've been far more interesting if the ""Hero"" remained a total whack job and a dirtbag like the manga but then again it would've probably never been made so",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern

Letterboxd,False,"Prometía un enfoque distinto del género zombie, pero la película se me hizo pesada y aburrida. La protagonista medio zombie queda reducida a dormir casi todo el tiempo, la escopeta es usada de manera totalmente irreal y el final abierto no ayuda a generar impacto. Se nota que es una adaptación recortada de un manga mucho más grande, y eso deja la sensación de que la historia no llega a ninguna parte.",I Am a Hero,2015,Eastern

Poderiam ter explorado mais a Hiromi, e eu gostei bastante do desenvolvimento do Hideo porque no decorrer do filme ele ""toma"" coragem e começa a lutar pela sua vida, bem interessante.

Letterboxd,False,"Tf you mean our protagonist ""hero"", who we are supposed to root for btw, wants to look at an underage girl's breast? This movie could have been something new for an overused genre like zombie apocalypse but it still falls for typical Japanese manga/anime mediocre tropes where female characters are always sexualized or infantalized all the time and male character is a perverted pathetic incel.
